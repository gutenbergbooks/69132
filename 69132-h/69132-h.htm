</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> of the girls in this story first became
acquainted with each other in their freshman
year at Harding College, and the story of
their four jolly years together and their trip
to Europe after graduation is told in “Betty
Wales, Freshman,” “Betty Wales, Sophomore,”
“Betty Wales, Junior,” “Betty Wales,
Senior,” and “Betty Wales, B. A.”</p>

<p>It was during this memorable trip that
Betty met Mr. Morton, the irascible but generous
railroad magnate. “Betty Wales &amp;
Co.” describes how Betty and her “little
friends” opened the successful “Tally-ho
Tea-Shop” in Harding, and what came of it.
Babbie Hildreth’s engagement to Mr. Thayer
was one result, and another was that Mr.
Morton gave to Harding College the money
for a dormitory for the poorer girls. Betty’s
“smallest sister” Dorothy was also in Harding
attending Miss Dick’s school, and it was
for her that Eugenia Ford invented the delightful
Ploshkin. Somebody modeled one,
and as little plaster ploshkins were soon being
sold everywhere, it turned out to be one of
the Tally-ho’s most popular and profitable
features. Betty had thought she would leave
the shop to Emily Davis and return to her family,
but this story tells how she found herself
again on the Harding Campus. And finally,
how Betty Wales, with the aid of one other
important person, chose her career and left
Harding, will be found in “Betty Wales
Decides.”</p>

<span class="smaller">“TENDING UP” AGAIN</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span>, with a red bandanna knotted
tightly over all her yellow curls&mdash;except one or
two particularly rebellious ringlets that positively
refused to be hidden&mdash;pattered softly
down the back stairs of the Wales cottage at
Lakeside. Softly, because mother was taking
her afternoon nap and must on no account be
disturbed. Betty lifted a lid of the kitchen
range, peered anxiously in at the glowing
coals, and nodded approvingly at them for
being so nice and red. Then she opened the
ice-box, just for the supreme satisfaction of
gazing once more upon the six big tomatoes
that she had peeled and put away to cool
right after lunch&mdash;which is the only proper
time to begin getting dinner for a fastidious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>family like hers. Finally she slipped on over
her bathing suit the raincoat that hung on
her arm, and carefully opened the front door.
On the piazza the Smallest Sister and a smaller
friend were cozily ensconced in the hammock,
“talking secrets,” as they explained eagerly
to Betty.</p>

<p>“But you can come and talk too,” they
assured her in a happy chorus, for Betty was
the idol of all the little girls in the Lakeside
colony.</p>

<p>Betty smiled at them and pulled back the
raincoat to show what was underneath.
“Thank you, dears, but I’m going for a dip
while the sun is hot. And Dorothy, don’t
forget that you’ve said that you’d stay here
and see to everything till I get back. And if
more girls come up, don’t make a lot of noise
and wake mother. Good-bye.” And she was
off like the wind down the path to the beach
staircase.</p>

<p>Half a dozen welcoming shouts greeted her
from the sand.</p>

<p>“We’ve waited ages for you,” cried one.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Dare you to slide down on the rail,”
called another.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="350" alt="“I’M SORRY I WAS LATE”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“I’M SORRY I WAS LATE”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p class="p2">“No, slide down the bank,” suggested a
third.</p>

<p>Betty gave her head a funny little toss,
threw the raincoat down to one of them and
slid, ran, jumped, and tumbled down the
sheer bank, landing in a heap on a mound of
soft sand that flew up in a dusty cloud around
the party.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she sputtered, wiping the dust
out of her eyes. “Sorry that I was late, I
mean. The sand is Don’s fault, because he
dared me. You see, I had to mend all Will’s
stockings, because he’s going off to-morrow on
a little business trip. And then I had to see
to my fire, and remind Dorothy that she is
now in charge of mother and the house. Beat
you out to the raft, Mary.”</p>

<p>Mary Hooper shook off her share of the
sand-cloud resignedly. “All right,” she
said. “Only of course I’ve been in once already,
and I’m rather tired.”</p>

<p>“Tired nothing,” scoffed one of the Benson
girls. “You paddled around the cove for five
minutes an hour ago, poor thing! That’s all
the exercise you’ve had to-day. Betty’s the
one who ought to be tired, with all the cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and scrubbing and mending she does.
Only she’s a regular young steam engine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty leaned forward and tumbled Sallie
Benson over on her back in the sand.
“Hush!” she said. “I don’t work hard, and
I’m not tired, and besides, I shall probably
lose the race. Come along, Mary.”</p>

<p>The race was a tie, but Betty declared that
Tom Benson got in her way on purpose, and
Mary Hooper retorted that Sally splashed her
like a whole school of porpoises. So they
finally agreed to try again going back, and
then they sat on the raft in the sunshine,
throwing sticks for Mary’s setter to swim after,
and watching the Ames boys dive, until Will
appeared on the shore shouting and waving a
letter wildly&mdash;an incentive to Betty’s getting
back in a hurry that caused Mary to declare
the return race off also, especially as she had
lost it.</p>

<p>“Didn’t want to bother you,” explained
Will amiably, “but Cousin Joe drove me out
in his car, and I thought that maybe the
chief cook&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty seized the letter and ran. “I knew
things were going to happen,” she murmured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>as she flopped up the beach stairway. “But
there’s an extra tomato that my prophetic
soul told me to peel, and lots of soup, and lots
of ice-cream. Oh, dear, I’m getting this letter
so wet that I shan’t ever be able to read it.”
She held it out at arm’s length and looked at
the address. It was typewritten, and there
was a printed “Return to Harding College”
in the corner. “Nothing but an old circular,
I suppose,” she decided, and laid it carefully
down in a spot of yellow sunshine on the floor
of her room to dry off.</p>

<p>Of course there was no time to open it until
dinner was cooked and eaten; and then Cousin
Joe piled his big car full of laughing, chattering
young people and drove them off through
the pine woods in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Betty was in front with Cousin Joe.
“Things look so much more enchanted and
fairylike if you’re in front,” she explained as
she climbed in.</p>

<p>Cousin Joe chuckled. “You always have
some good reason for wanting to sit in front,
young lady,” he said. “When you were a
kid, you had to be where you could cluck to
the horses. But I certainly didn’t suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>you went in for moonlight and fairies and
that sort of thing. I thought you were a
hard-headed business woman, with all kinds
of remarkable money-making schemes up
your sleeves.”</p>

<p>Betty patted the embroidery on her cuff
and frowned disapprovingly at him. “You
shouldn’t make fun of the Tally-ho Tea-Shop,
Cousin Joe. It does make money&mdash;really
and truly it does.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I know that,” Cousin Joe
assured her solemnly, “and I understand the
extremely marketable nature of ploshkins.
Will keeps me very well posted about his
wonderful sister’s wonderful enterprises that
are backed by the Morton millions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, please, Cousin Joe,” begged
Betty. “I’ve just done what any girl would
have under the circumstances, and I’ve had
such very scrumptious luck&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>Cousin Joe put on slow speed, and leaned
forward to stare at Betty in the moonlight.
“You’ve pulled off a start that any man
might envy you, little girl, and you’re just as
pretty and young and jolly as if you’d never
touched money except to spend it for clothes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>and candy. And you still love fun and look
out for fairies, and some day a nice young
man&mdash;I say, Betty, here’s a long straight
stretch. Change seats and see how fast
you can tool her up to the Pine Grove
Country Club for a cool little supper all
around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could I truly try?”</p>

<p>Betty’s voice sounded like a happy child’s,
and her eyes sparkled with pleasure and excitement,
as her small hands clutched the big
wheel.</p>

<p>Cousin Joe leaned back and watched her.
“I had a tough pull when I started out in
life,” he was thinking, “and no ‘such very
scrumptious luck,’ either, and I let it sour me.
Betty’s game, luck or no luck. Luck’s not
the word for it, anyway. Of course people
want to keep friends with the girl who owns
that smile. It means something, her smile
does. It’s not in the same class with Miss
Mary Hooper’s society smirk. I can’t see
myself why that nice young man that I
almost said was going to fall in love with her
some day doesn’t come along&mdash;several of him
in fact. But I’m glad I didn’t finish that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>sentence; I suppose you could spoil even
Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>Betty remembered her letter again when
she stepped on it in the dark and it crackled.
She had undressed by moonlight, so as not to
wake little Dorothy, who shared her room at
the cottage. Now she lit a candle, and opening
her letter read it in the dim flickering
light. Something dropped out&mdash;a long slip
that proved, upon further examination, to be
a railroad ticket from Cleveland to Harding
and back again. And the typewritten letter&mdash;that
might have been “only an old circular”&mdash;was
signed by no less a personage than the
President of Harding College himself. Seeing
his name at the end, in the queer scraggly
hand that every Harding girl knew, quite
took Betty’s breath away, and as for the letter
itself! When she had finished it Betty blew
out the candle and sank down in an awe-stricken
little heap on the floor by the window
to think things over and straighten them out.</p>

<p>Prexy had written to her himself&mdash;the great
Prexy! He wanted her to come and advise
with him and Mr. Morton and the architects
about the finishing touches for Morton Hall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>Of all absurd, unaccountable ideas that was the
queerest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton originally suggested asking
you,” he wrote, “but I heartily second him.
We both feel sure that the ingenuity of the
young woman who made the Tally-ho Tea-Shop
out of a barn will devise some valuable
features for the new dormitory, thereby fitting
it more completely to the needs of its future
occupants.”</p>

<p>Morton Hall was the result of a suggestion
Betty had made to her friend Mr. Morton,
the millionaire. It was to give the poorer
girls at Harding an opportunity to live on the
campus and share in the college life.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” sighed Betty. “He thinks I
thought up all the tea-room features. It’s
Madeline that they want. But Madeline’s in
Maine with the Enderbys, and wouldn’t come.
And then of course Mr. Morton may need to
be pacified about something. I can do that
part all right. Anyway, I shall have to go,
so long as they have sent a ticket&mdash;right away
too, or Mr. Morton will be sure to need pacifying
most awfully. I wonder what in the
world that postscript means.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The postscript said, “I had intended to
write you in regard to another matter, connected
not so much with the architecture of
the new hall as with its management; but
talking it over together will be much more
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>Betty lay awake a long while wondering
about that postscript. When she finally went
to sleep she dreamed that Prexy had hired her
to cook for Morton Hall, and that she scorched
the ice-cream, put salt in the jelly-roll, and
water on the fire. She burned her fingers
doing that and screamed, and it was Will
calling to remind her that he wanted breakfast
and his bag packed in time for the eight-sixteen.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table the cook&mdash;she ate
with the family&mdash;gave notice. She was going
away that very afternoon.</p>

<p>“Most unbusinesslike,” Mr. Wales assured
her solemnly, but with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Most absurd,” Betty twinkled back at him.
“I can’t suggest a thing to those architects,
of course, and they’ll just laugh at me, and
Prexy and Mr. Morton will be perfectly disgusted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got to make good somehow,” Will
assured her soberly. “It isn’t every girl that
gets her expenses paid for a long trip like that,
just to go and advise about things. You’re
what they call a consulting expert, Betty.
I’ll look up your trains and telephone you
from town.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll help you pack a bag,” announced
the Smallest Sister. “You’re just going in a
bag, like Will, and coming back for Sunday,
aren’t you, Betty dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m just going in a bag,” Betty assured
her laughingly, “and coming right back
to Lakeside for Sunday. But perhaps in
September&mdash;well, we need not think about
September when it’s only the middle of
August; isn’t that so, little sister?”</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister stared solemnly at her.
“We ought to make plans, Betty. Now
Celissa Hooper wants me to be her chum if
I’m going to school in Cleveland this winter,
but if I’m going to be at Miss Dick’s again
why of course I can’t be chums with Celissa,
’cause I’m chums with Shirley Ware. So I
really ought to know before long who I’m to
be chums with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“You certainly ought,” agreed Betty earnestly.
“But you’ll just have to be very good
friends with Celissa and with Shirley and with
all the other girls until I come back, and then
mother and father and you and I can have a
grand pow-wow over you and me and the tea-shop
and Miss Dick’s and everything else
under the sun. Now, who’s going to wipe
dishes for me this morning?”</p>

<p>“I am. What’s a grand pow-wow?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have one in the kitchen,” Betty explained
diplomatically, hurrying off with both
hands full of dishes.</p>

<p>But the pow-wow was a rather spiritless
affair.</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of something else, Betty
Wales,” declared the Smallest Sister accusingly,
right in the midst of the story of the
Reckless Ritherum, who is second cousin to
the Ploshkin and has a very nice tale of its
own. “If you’re going to look way off over
my head and think of something else, I guess
I’d rather go up-stairs and make beds all by
my lonesome.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, dearie,” Betty apologized
humbly, “but you see I feel just like a reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
ritherum myself this morning&mdash;going
out to play with three terrible giants.”</p>

<p>“What giants are you going to play with?”
demanded the Smallest Sister incredulously.</p>

<p>“The fierce giant, the wise giant, and the
head of all the giants,” Betty told her. “The
fierce giant eats reckless little ritherums for
his breakfast&mdash;that’s Mr. Morton. The wise
giant laughs at them when they try to show
him how to make the house that Jack built&mdash;that’s
the New York architect. The head of
all the giants&mdash;that’s Prexy&mdash;shakes the paw
of the poor little Ritherum kindly, and asks
it not to be so silly again as to try to play
with giants, and it gets smaller and smaller
and smaller&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just exactly like Alice in Wonderland,”
put in the Smallest Sister excitedly.</p>

<p>“Until it runs home,” Betty concluded,
“to play with a little girl named Dorothy
Wales, and then all of a sudden it gets big
and happy and reckless again.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t be gone long,” advised
Dorothy eagerly, “because I’m always in a
hurry to begin playing with you some more.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Betty bowed gravely. “In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>that case I won’t let the fierce giant eat me,
nor the wise giant blow me away with his big
laugh, nor the head giant stare at me until I
vanish, recklessness and all, into the Bay of
the Ploshkin.”</p>

<p>“I’d fish you up, if you did fall into the
bay,” Dorothy assured her, with a sudden hug
that ended fatally for a coffee-cup she was
wiping.</p>

<p>“But it was nicked anyway, so never mind,”
Betty comforted her, “and you’ve fished me
up lots of times already, so I know you would
again.”</p>

<p>“Why, I never&mdash;&mdash;” began the Smallest
Sister in amazement.</p>

<p>“All right for you,” Betty threatened, putting
away her pans with a great clatter. “If
you’ve stopped believing in fairies and if
you’ve forgotten how you ever went to the
Bay of the Ploshkin and fished up ritherums
and did other interesting things, why should
I waste my time telling you stories?”</p>

<p>This terrible threat silenced the Smallest
Sister, who therefore never found out how or
when she had “fished up” her sister. But
on the way east Betty, still feeling very like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>a ritherum, consoled herself by remembering
first her own simile, and then Will’s “Maybe
I’m not proud to know you!” blurted out as
he had put her on board her train. A little
sister to hug one and a big brother to bestow
foolishly unqualified admiration are just the
very nicest things that a reckless ritherum
can have. And who hasn’t felt like a reckless
ritherum some time or other?</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was pacing the station platform
agitatedly when Betty’s train pulled in.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three minutes late, Miss B. A.,” he
panted, rushing up to her. He had always
called her that. It stood for Benevolent
Adventurer, and some other things. Grasping
her bag and her arm, he pulled her down the
stairs to his big red touring car. “The way
these railroads are run is abominable&mdash;a disgrace
to the country, in my opinion. Now
when I say I’ll get to a place at four <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>&mdash;I
mean it. And very likely I arrive at six by
train&mdash;most unbusinesslike. Well, it’s not
exactly your fault that idiots run our railroads,
is it, Miss B. A.? I thought of that without
your telling me&mdash;give me a long credit mark
for once. Well, I certainly am glad to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>you, and to find you looking so brown and
jolly. No bothers and worries these days,
Miss B. A.?”</p>

<p>“Except the responsibility of having to
think up enough good suggestions for Morton
Hall to pay you for asking me to come and
for taking the time to be here to meet me,”
Betty told him laughingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton snorted his indignation. “That
responsibility may worry you, but it doesn’t
me&mdash;not one particle. Now, by the way, don’t
be upset by any idiotic remarks of the young
architect chap that has this job in charge.
Whatever a person wants, he says you can’t
have it&mdash;that seems to be his idea of doing
business. Then after you’ve shown him that
your idea of doing business is to do it or know
the reason why, he sits down and figures the
thing out in great shape. He’s a very smart
young fellow, but he hates to give in. I
presume that’s why Parsons and Cope put
him on this job&mdash;they’ve done work for me
before, and they know that I have ideas of my
own and won’t be argued out of them except
by a fellow who can convince me he really
knows more about the job than I do. Just the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>same, don’t you pay much attention to his
obstruction game. Remember that you’re
here because I want this dormitory to be the
way you want it.”</p>

<p>Betty promised just as the car drew up in
front of the Tally-ho. “Thought you’d like
a cup of your own tea,” explained Mr. Morton,
“and a sight of your new electric fixtures,
and so forth. Miss Davis is expecting you.
Let’s see.” He consulted his watch, comparing
it carefully with Betty’s and with the
clock in the automobile, which aroused his
intense irritation by being two minutes
slow. “It’s now three forty-one. I’ll be
back in nineteen minutes. If I can find that
architect chap, I’ll bring him along. He
knows all the main features of the building
better than I do, and he’s a pretty glib talker,
so I guess we’ll let him take you over the
place the first time.”</p>

<p>Exactly nineteen minutes later, just as
Betty and Emily Davis had “begun to get
ready to start to commence,” according to
Emily’s favorite formula, the inspection of
the tea-shop and the exchange of summer
experiences, the big red car came snorting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>back and stopped with a jerk to let out a tall
young man, who ran across the lawn and in
at the Tally-ho’s hospitably opened door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton wishes to know if Miss
Wales&mdash;&mdash;” he began. Then he rushed up
to Betty. “By all that’s amazing, the great
Miss Wales is the one I used to know! How
are you, Betty?”</p>

<p>“Why, Jim Watson, where did you come
from?” demanded Betty in amazement.</p>

<p>Jim’s eyes twinkled. “From the Morton
Mercedes most recently, and until I get back
to it with you I’m afraid we’d better defer
further explanations.”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “Only you must just meet
Emily Davis&mdash;Miss Davis, Mr. Watson. She’s
a friend of Eleanor’s too. And you must tell
me one thing. Is the architect out there with
Mr. Morton?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jim solemnly, “he isn’t, naturally,
since he’s in here with you. Architect
Watson, with Parsons and Cope, at your service,
Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>“Are you the real one&mdash;the one in charge?”
persisted Betty. “You aren’t the one that
won’t let Mr. Morton have his own way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“I am that very one,” Jim assured her
briskly, “but there are some lengths to which
I don’t go. So please come along to the car
in a hurry, or I shall certainly be sent back to
New York forthwith.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! That would be perfectly dreadful!
Good-bye, Emily.” Betty sped down
the path at top speed, Jim after her.</p>

<p>“Did you stop to introduce yourself in
detail, Watson?” inquired Mr. Morton irritably,
opening the door of the tonneau.</p>

<p>“He didn’t have to introduce himself,”
Betty put in breathlessly, “but I made him
stop to explain himself, and now I certainly
shan’t worry about his objections and opinions,
because I’ve known him for ages. Why, he’s
Eleanor Watson’s brother Jim. You’ve heard
Babe and me talk about Eleanor.”</p>

<p>“I should say that I have,” cried Mr.
Morton jubilantly. “So you can manage her
brother as nicely as you manage me, can you,
Miss B. A.? I knew you ought to come up
and see to things. Hurry along a little,
Jonas, can’t you? We’re not out riding for
our health to-day. There are some little
things I haven’t just liked, and now that I’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>got Miss B. A. to help me manage you&mdash;&mdash; Feeling
scared, Watson?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, sir, thank you,” said Jim with
his sunniest smile. “But I’m certainly feeling
glad to see Miss Betty again.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Glad to see Miss B. A.?
Well, I should certainly hope so,” snapped
Jasper J. Morton. “I’d have a good deal less
use for you, sir, than I’ve had so far, if you
weren’t.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ARCHITECT’S PLANS&mdash;AND OTHERS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stopping</span> at Prexy’s house to get him to
join the grand tour brought back Betty’s
“ritherum” feeling very hard indeed. Jim
was so dignified and businesslike when he
talked to Prexy and Mr. Morton; they were
both so dignified and intent on their plans for
Morton Hall. And evidently they all seriously
expected Betty to do something about
it. Betty set her lips, twisted her handkerchief
into a hard little knot, and walked up
to the door, resolved to do the something expected
of her or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>Jim, who was ahead, had the door open for
the others when Mr. Morton commanded a
halt.</p>

<p>“Might as well be systematic,” he ordered,
“and take things as they come,&mdash;or as we
come, rather. Now, Miss B. A., shall there or
shan’t there be a ploshkin put up over this
front door?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“A ploshkin over the front door?” Betty
repeated helplessly.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” snapped Mr. Morton, who disliked
repetition as much as he disliked other
kinds of delay. “What could be more appropriate
than a large ploshkin, cut in marble,
of course, by a first-class sculptor? Stands for
you, stands for earning a living when you
have to, therefore stands for me and my
methods, stands for our coöperation in putting
through a good thing, whether it’s a silly
plaster flub-dub that half-witted people will
run to buy, or a building like this with a big
idea back of it. But Mr. President here seems
to think I’m wrong in some way, and young
Watson says a ploshkin won’t harmonize with
the general style of the architecture. Now
what do you say, Miss B. A.?”</p>

<p>Betty suppressed a wild desire to laugh, as
she looked from one to another of her three
Giants’ faces. “Please don’t be disappointed,
Mr. Morton,” she began at last timidly, “but
I’m afraid I think you’re wrong too. A
ploshkin&mdash;why, a ploshkin’s just nonsense!
It would look ridiculous to stick one up
there.” She laughed in spite of herself at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>idea. “It’s 19&mdash;’s class animal, you know.
The Belden might as well have a purple cow,
and the Westcott a yellow chick, and some
other house a raging lion to commemorate the
other class animals. Oh, Mr. Morton, you are
just too comical about some things!”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton frowned fiercely, and then
sighed resignedly. “Very well, Miss B. A.
It’s your ploshkin. If you say no, that settles
it. Mr. President, you and young Watson can
decide between that Greek goddess of wisdom
you mentioned and any other outlandish
notion you’ve thought of since. It’s all one
to me. Now let’s be systematic. The next
unsettled row that we have on hand is about
the reception-room doors.”</p>

<p>This time, fortunately, Betty could agree
with Mr. Morton, and the others yielded gracefully,
being much relieved at her first decision.
Then, quite unexpectedly, she had an idea of
her own.</p>

<p>“Laundry bills cost a lot, and the Harding
wash-women tear your thin things dreadfully.
It would be just splendid if there could be a
place in the basement where the Morton Hall
girls could go to wash and iron, and press
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>their skirts, and smooth out their thin
dresses.”</p>

<p>Everybody agreed to this; the Giants forgot
their differences and grew quite friendly
discussing it. And up-stairs Betty thought of
something else.</p>

<p>“Typewriters and sewing-machines are
dreadfully noisy. That’s one reason why the
cheap off-campus houses are so uncomfortable,
where most of the girls use one or the other or
both. I remember Emily Davis used to say
that sometimes it seemed as if her head
would burst with the click and the clatter. If
there could only be a room for typewriters
and a sewing-room, with sound-proof
walls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There can be,” interrupted Jasper J. Morton
oracularly, “and there shall be, if we
have to put an annex to accommodate them.
Miss B. A., you’ll ruin me if you keep on at
this rate. I presume I’m expected to install
typewriters and sewing-machines. They’re
part of the fixtures, aren’t they, Watson? If
I say so they are? Well, I do say so, provided
Miss B. A. accepts that proposal
from&mdash;&mdash; See here, Mr. President, why don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>you take her off in a quiet corner and tell
her what you want of her?”</p>

<p>Betty blushed violently at the idea of giving
such summary advice to the great Prexy.</p>

<p>“Please don’t hurry,” she begged. “You
can tell me what you want to any time, President
Wallace. Mr. Morton is always in such
a rush to get things settled himself; he
doesn’t realize that other people don’t feel the
same way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I realize it?” snorted Mr. Morton
indignantly. “Haven’t I spent half my life
hunting for people that can keep my pace?
But I beg your pardon, Mr. President, if I
seemed to dictate or to meddle in your personal
affairs.”</p>

<p>Prexy’s eyes twinkled. “That’s all right,
Mr. Morton. Let’s give him his way this
time, Miss Wales, as long as we’ve got ours
about the ploshkin. Come and sit on that
broad and inviting window-seat, and hear
what we want you to do for us.”</p>

<p>It was an amazing proposal, though Prexy
made it in the calmest and most matter-of-fact
way. The Student’s Aid Association, it
seemed, had reorganized at its commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
meeting, had received a substantial endowment
fund&mdash;so much Betty already knew&mdash;and
had since decided to employ a paid
secretary to direct its work and to look after
the interests of the self-supporting students.
It had occurred to President Wallace that the
right place for the secretary to live was in
Morton Hall, and to the directors that the right
person to act as secretary was Betty Wales.</p>

<p>“The salary is small,” explained Prexy,
“but the duties at first will be light, I should
think. I assume that you will be in Harding
in any case, to supervise your tea-shop enterprise.
Now this salary will pay several extra
helpers there, and give you time for an occupation
that may be more congenial and that
will certainly be of real help to the girls you
have always wanted to help&mdash;to the whole
college also, I hope. Living in this hall instead
of the regular house teacher, you will
have a chance to keep in touch with us as you
could not off the campus, and you will still
be reasonably near to the famous Tally-ho
Tea-Shop.”</p>

<p>When he had finished, Betty continued to
stare at him in bewildered silence. “How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>does it strike you, Miss Wales?” he asked,
with an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>Betty “came to” with a frightened little
gasp.</p>

<p>“Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;it strikes me as too big to take
in all at once, and much, much too splendid
for me, President Wallace. I should just love
to do it, of course. But I can’t imagine myself
doing it. Now Christy Mason or Emily
or Rachel Morrison&mdash;I could imagine them
doing it beautifully, but not me&mdash;I&mdash;me.
Oh, dear!” Betty stopped in complete confusion.</p>

<p>“But the rest of us can easily imagine you
as the first secretary of the Student’s Aid,”
Prexy told her kindly. “We considered several
others, but none of them quite fitted.
We are all sure that you will fit. The board
of directors wished you to understand that
the choice was unanimous. As for me, I’ve
always meant to get you on the Harding faculty
some way or other, because the Harding
spirit is the most important thing that any of
us has to teach, and you know how to teach it.
This position will enable you to specialize on
the Harding spirit without bothering your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>head about logarithms or the principles of exposition
or cuneiform inscriptions or Spanish
verbs. It seems like a real opportunity, and
I hope you can take it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so, too!” exclaimed Betty
eagerly. “But the trouble is, President Wallace,
the world seems to be just crammed with
opportunities, and they conflict. One that
conflicts with this is the opportunity to stay
at home with my family. I hadn’t decided,
when I got your letter, whether I ought to
come back to the tea-shop, or be with mother
and father this winter. But living here and
looking out for the Morton Hall girls does
sound just splendid. Please, what would be
the duties of the secretary, President Wallace?”</p>

<p>The President smiled. “Whatever you made
them, I think. Perhaps the Student’s Aid
directors may want to offer a few suggestions,
but in the main I guarantee you a perfectly
free hand.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that even worse than to be told just
what to do&mdash;harder, I mean?” demanded
Betty, so despairingly that Prexy threw back
his head and laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Think it over,” he advised. “Talk it
over with Mr. Morton and your family.
Write to your friends about it. By the way,
I suppose you know that Miss Morrison
and Miss Adams are to be members of our
faculty next year.”</p>

<p>Betty knew about Rachael’s appointment,
but not about Helen’s.</p>

<p>“Oh, it would be great to be back,” she declared.
“There’s no question of what I want
to do,&mdash;only of what I ought to do, and what
I can do. It would be terrible if I should
start and then have to give up because I
didn’t know how to go on. It would be
worse than being ‘flunked out’&mdash;I mean than
failing to pass your examinations,” added
Betty hastily.</p>

<p>“I understand the expression ‘flunked
out,’” Prexy assured her gaily, “but I
never noticed any of your kind of girl in
the ‘flunked out’ ranks. Well, think it
all over. Mr. Morton will dance with impatience
when he finds that everything
can’t be decided in a breath, and just as
he wants it, but we’ll let him dance a little;
and if he uses too persuasive powers on you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>in the meantime I should not be unwarrantably
interfering if I objected.”</p>

<p>“He can’t object to you dictating in his
private affairs a little,” quoted Betty gaily,
as they went back to join the other Giants,
who were sitting on a pile of lumber, animatedly
discussing the relative merits of different
makes of typewriters.</p>

<p>“Sewing-machines we leave entirely to you,
Miss B. A.,” Mr. Morton told her, with a
keen glance that tried to guess at her reception
of Prexy’s offer. “Just let me know
the kind you want and the number. No
hurry.”</p>

<p>“That means that in about ten minutes
he’ll ask you what you’ve decided,” murmured
Jim in her ear. “Haven’t you had
enough of business for to-day, Betty? Let’s
cut out and take a walk in Paradise before
dinner. We can just about catch the sunset
if we hurry.</p>

<p>“My eye, but it seems good to see you
again,” Jim assured her warmly, as they
scrambled down the path to the river. “And
it seems good to see Paradise again, only it
doesn’t look natural in its present uninhabited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
state. There ought to be a pretty girl
in a pretty dress behind every big tree.”</p>

<p>Betty demanded the latest news of Eleanor,
who was a very bad correspondent, and then
burst forth with her own plans and perplexities.</p>

<p>“I think you should accept the Harding
offer by all means,” Jim assured her soberly.
“Only there’s one thing I ought to tell you.
I’ve been trying for a week to screw my
courage up to the point of confiding it to
the peppery Mr. Morton. His beloved dormitory
can’t possibly be finished in time for
the opening of college.”</p>

<p>Betty looked her dismay. “He’ll be perfectly
furious, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” returned Jim firmly. “He
comes up nearly every week, and at least once
in ten minutes, while he’s here, he decides to
enlarge or rebuild something. See how he
upset everything to-day for your sewing-machines
and typewriters and washing-machines.
To-morrow some book-worm will get hold of
him and suggest a library, and he’ll want us
to design some patent bookcases and build a
wing to put them in.” Jim looked Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>straight in the eyes. “You simply can’t
hurry a good honest job. I’m likely to be
hanging around here till Christmas.”</p>

<p>“As long as that?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded, still scrutinizing her face
closely. “Of course I know it won’t make
any difference to you, but it would make all
kinds of difference to me, having you here.
You can be dead sure of that, Betty.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled at him encouragingly. “You
mean you want me to be here to protect you
from the pretty girls in pretty gowns who will
begin jumping out at you from behind the
trees the day college opens?”</p>

<p>Jim shrugged his broad shoulders defiantly.
“I’m not afraid of any pretty girls. I suppose
it will be a fierce game going around the
campus with no other man in sight, but I
guess I can play it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” murmured Betty, who was in
a teasing mood. “You want me to introduce
you to the very prettiest pretty girls.”</p>

<p>“Prexy can do that,” Jim told her calmly.
“He’s my firm friend since I stood by him so
nobly in the war of the ploshkin. But I do
hope you’ll be here. We could have some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>bully walks and rides, Betty&mdash;you ride, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “But I shall be dreadfully
busy&mdash;if I come.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you work,” Jim offered gallantly.
“I understand this secretary proposition pretty
well. I was secretary to the O. M.&mdash;Old Man,
that stands for, otherwise the august head of
our firm&mdash;until they put me on this little job.
I could give you pointers, I’m sure, though
it’s not exactly the same sort of thing you’re
up against. And I say, Betty, Eleanor has
half promised me to come on this fall while
I’m here. I’m sure she’ll do it if you’re here
too.”</p>

<p>“That would be splendid,” Betty admitted,
“only of course I couldn’t decide to come just
for a lark, Jim. I mustn’t let that part of it
influence me a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, just the same”&mdash;Jim played his last
and highest card,&mdash;“if you want to be a real
philanthropist, Miss Betty Wales, you’ll let
me influence you a little. If ever there was
a good object for charity, it’s a fellow who
hasn’t seen any of his family for nine months
and has had to give up a paltry two weeks’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>vacation that he’d been counting the hours to,
to hold down a job that may, in a dozen years
or so, lead to something good. It takes stick,
I can tell you, Betty, this making your way
in the world, and sometimes it’s a pretty lonesome
proposition. But I don’t intend to be
just dad’s good-for-nothing son all my life, so
I’m bound to keep at it. I hate a quitter just
as much as dad does. I can tell you, though,
it helps to have a good friend around to talk
things over with.”</p>

<p>Betty’s brown eyes grew big and soft, and
her voice vibrated with sympathy. “Don’t I
know that, Jim? Last year when Madeline
and Babbie were both away at once it seemed
as if things always went wrong at the Tally-ho,
and I used to nearly die, worrying. And
when they came back and we talked everything
over, there was usually nothing much
the matter.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Jim. “So don’t forget
me when you’re footing up the philanthropic
activities that you can amuse yourself
with if you decide on a Harding
winter.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I won’t,” she promised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>gaily, “although you don’t look a bit like an
object of charity, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Appearances are frequently deceitful,” Jim
assured her.</p>

<p>“I should think so.” Betty jumped up in
dismay. “I appear to have the evening before
me, but really I’ve promised to take dinner
with Mr. Morton.”</p>

<p>“Who-can’t-be-kept-waiting,” chanted Jim,
giving her a hand up the steep bank.</p>

<p>Betty stayed in Harding two days, during
which she had many long talks with Emily
about the secretaryship and its possibilities.
Being, as she picturesquely put it, a Morton
Hall girl born too soon, Emily could speak
from experience, and she suggested all sorts
of things that Betty would never have
thought of.</p>

<p>“But that’s all I can do,” she told Betty,
when that modest little person declared that
Emily, and not she, was surely the ideal
secretary. “I can explain what ought to be
done, but I couldn’t do it. It takes a person
with bushels of tact to manage those girls.
Maybe you aren’t as good at planning as
Rachel or I. That’s nothing. You’ve got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>the bushels of tact. That’s the unique
quality that the directors had the sense to
see was indispensable. You’re ‘elected’ to
accept, Betty dear, so you might just as well
telegraph for your trunks.”</p>

<p>But Betty did nothing quite so summary.
She wanted to talk things over with the
family, who would be sorely disappointed, she
knew, if she decided to come back to Harding,
after she had hinted that perhaps the Tally-ho
could go on with only flitting visits from its
Head Manager. Besides, there was no use in
losing the rest of August at Lakeside, and the
Smallest Sister would grieve bitterly if the
ritherum broke its promise to come home
soon and play. Betty resolved to have
Dorothy back again in Miss Dick’s school.
There were lonely times and discouraged times
ahead of her, she knew, and if a little sister
is a responsibility, she is much more of a
comfort. Mother would have Will and father,
and if father went South again she would
want to go too, so it wouldn’t be selfish to ask
for Dorothy, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But in her secret soul, Betty knew that the
“if” was a very, very small one. Father and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>mother would tell her to do what she felt was
best, and she had no doubt about her final
decision. She almost owed it to Mr. Morton
to do anything she could toward making his
splendid gift to Harding as useful as possible,
and if Prexy and the directors and Emily
were right she could do a great deal.</p>

<p>“And isn’t it splendid,” she reflected, “that
when I’ve got less money than ever I can do
more? That proves that money isn’t everything&mdash;it
isn’t anything unless you are big
enough to make it something. Oh, dear!
What if I shouldn’t ‘make good,’ as Will
says? Why, I’ve just got to!”</p>

<p>Betty set her lips again and walked down
the platform of the Cleveland station with her
head so high that she almost ran into Will,
who had come to meet her.</p>

<p>“Get along all right?” he demanded
briskly.</p>

<p>“All right so far,” Betty told him, “but
there’s more ahead, and it’s fifty times bigger
than anything I’ve tried before.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Will took it placidly. “No
better jobs in this world without extra work.
If it wasn’t a lot bigger thing than you’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>tackled before, it probably wouldn’t be worth
your while.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed as she surveyed him admiringly.
“I suppose you’re right. I wish I
were a man. They’re always so calm and
cool. No, I don’t wish that either. I’m glad
I’m a girl and can get just as excited as I like,
and act what you call ‘all up in the air’ once
in a while. I don’t believe things are half so
much fun when a person doesn’t get dreadfully
excited about them. So now, Will
Wales!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CULT OF THE B. C. A.’S</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Betty first unfolded what Will flippantly
called the Morton-Prexy Proposition
to the family circle, the “if” loomed very
large indeed on mother’s face and larger still
on Dorothy’s.</p>

<p>It would be too much for Betty, mother said.
“And I don’t want my little girl to get tired
and dragged-out and old before she has to.
There was some reason in her trying to earn
money in her own way last year, but now
there isn’t the least sense in plunging into
this project, just when the tea-shop is so
nicely started and she has won the right to
an easy time.”</p>

<p>“But, mother dear,” Betty interposed, “an
easy time isn’t the chief thing in life.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly a cause worth living for, is it,
child?” laughed father. “And being cook
to the Wales family in the intervals when
they happen to have a kitchen never did seem
to satisfy your lofty aspirations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it does, father,” declared Betty soberly,
“but you’re going to board again this winter,
so I can’t be cook much longer. It’s just a
question of where I’m needed most. That
sounds dreadfully conceited, but it really
isn’t.”</p>

<p>So father laughed, and said that he and
mother would “talk it over,” whereat Will
winked wickedly at Betty in a way that
meant, “Everything’s settled your way,
then,” and hustled her off to dress for a
tennis match, in which the skill of the Wales
family was to be pitted against that of the
Bensons. And just as the Wales family had
won two sets out of a hard-fought three,
father was saying diplomatically to mother
on the piazza, “Well, dear, I think you’re
right as usual; we ought to let her go and try
herself out. It’s not many parents whose
daughters are sought for to fill positions of
such trust and responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I hope she won’t have to learn to run a
typewriter like a regular secretary,” sighed
mother, who had never in the world meant to
let herself be coaxed, by father’s adroit
methods, into approving or even permitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>another of those “dreadful modern departures”
that her old-school training and conservative
temper united to disapprove.</p>

<p>Father smiled at her indulgently. “If
girls learned to write a copper-plate hand
nowadays as they did when you were young,
we shouldn’t be so dependent on typewriters.
Betty’s scrawl is no worse than the rest.
Well, now that this matter is settled and off
our minds, let’s walk out to the big bluff before
dark.”</p>

<p>So the discussion was closed, the “if”
dwindled to nothingness once more, and two
weeks after Jim Watson had assisted Mr. Morton
to see Betty off in a fashion befitting that
gentleman’s idea of her importance, he was at
the Harding station to meet her&mdash;quite without
assistance.</p>

<p>“Was I the last straw?” he inquired gaily,
as they walked down the long platform
toward Main Street.</p>

<p>“The last straw?” repeated Betty absently.
She was wondering whether the Student’s Aid
seniors would expect her to help meet the
freshmen at their trains.</p>

<p>“Well, the last figure in the column that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>you added up in order to estimate the possibilities
of Harding as a mission field,”
amended Jim. “Because if I helped to turn
the scales in favor of your coming here I can
at last consider myself a useful member of
society.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t be absurd, Jim,” Betty ordered
sternly. “Whatever else you do, I’m sure
you’ll never succeed in being a brilliant object
of charity.”</p>

<p>“Unappreciated, as usual,” sighed Jim.
“Nevertheless I invite you to have an ice at
Cuyler’s. It’s going to be very awkward,
Betty&mdash;your being proprietress of the Tally-ho.
I can never ask you to feed there.”</p>

<p>“But you can ask all the pretty girls I’m
going to introduce you to,” Betty suggested,
but Jim only shrugged his shoulders sceptically.</p>

<p>“Pretty girls are all right,” he said, “but I
already know as many girls here as I can
manage&mdash;or I shall when they all arrive.
Don’t forget that I’m to help you meet Miss
Helen Chase Adams to-night, and Miss Morrison
to-morrow, and Miss Ayres whenever
she telegraphs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“You mustn’t neglect your work,” Betty
warned him.</p>

<p>“Shan’t,” Jim assured her. “I’ve merely
arranged it so I can meet all Eleanor’s
friends’ trains. There’s everything in arrangement.
I generally begin my arduous
duties at nine, but to-morrow seven o’clock
shall see me up and at ’em&mdash;meaning the
carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, sewing-machine
agents, and all the rest of my menials.”</p>

<p>“With all the extra men that Mr. Morton
had sent up, can’t you possibly get through
before Christmas?” demanded Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>“I can’t say yet,” Jim told her. “Is it so
long to wait for your sewing-machines and
things?”</p>

<p>“Perfect ages!”</p>

<p>Jim frowned. Betty didn’t mean to be unkind,
but any one else, he reflected sadly,
would have considered the personal side of
the matter. Betty was a jolly girl, but all
she really cared for was this confounded
philanthropic job&mdash;and her tea-shop, maybe.
She expected a fellow to be the same&mdash;all
wrapped up in his job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Madeline arrived, according to custom, ten
minutes before her telegram, and swung
up the Tally-ho steps to the lilting tune
of her famous song, “Back to the College
Again.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Betty! Hello, Emily! Hello,
Nora and Bridget! I say, but isn’t this Improved
Version of the Tally-ho almost too
grand? No, I didn’t write. I couldn’t; I
didn’t decide in time. I had a special article
on fresh air children to write up for a friend
of Dick’s, and a Woman’s Page for the
‘Leader,’ because the person who does it
usually, known to Newspaper Row as Madam
Bon Ton, has gone on a vacation to Atlantic
City. But I sat up all last night out at Bob’s,
listening to her merry tales and writing them
down, and then pinching her awake to tell
me more whenever I ran out of material.
And I did the Woman’s Page on the train
coming up here. We ought to have a real
celebration for me after I’ve worked so hard
as all that just to come.”</p>

<p>“You go ahead and plan one and we’ll
have it,” Betty promised recklessly.</p>

<p>Madeline nodded, and rushed on to something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
else. “Is Rachel really going to teach
Zoo, and is Helen Chase Adams going to
adorn the English department? Christy
wrote me about her appointment for History.
Why, Betty, there’ll be a regular Harding
colony of the finest class this year. You
round them all up for tea to-morrow, and I’ll
have the celebration ready. Never fear about
that!”</p>

<p>“You want Mary Brooks Hinsdale, of
course,” Betty suggested.</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “All the old bunch, but
nobody who’s still in college. It’s to be
strictly a B. C. A. party, tell them.”</p>

<p>“Madeline,” demanded Emily sternly, “do
you know what that stands for, or are you going
to think something up later?”</p>

<p>Madeline grinned placidly. “Dearest girl,
as Madam Bon Ton calls all her fair correspondents,
never so far forget your breeding
as to give way to idle curiosity. It tends to
create wrinkles. And speaking of wrinkles,
do you suppose Georgia will murder or otherwise
dispose of her new roommate and take
me in for the night?”</p>

<p>They were all there the next afternoon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>Little Helen Chase Adams was just as prim
and demure as ever, but the great honor that
had come to her had put a permanent sparkle
in her eyes, and added a comical touch of
confidence to her manner. Rachel’s air of
quiet dignity that the head of her department
approved of only made the funny
stories she told of her first experiences as a
“faculty” all the funnier. Christy was her
old, serene, dependable self. Mary, in a very
becoming new suit, smiled her “beamish”
smile at everybody, and argued violently with
Madeline about the relative importance of being
a “small” faculty or a “big” faculty’s
wife.</p>

<p>“George Garrison Hinsdale is a genius, and
he says he couldn’t live without me,” declared
Mary modestly but firmly. Then she smiled
again at the obvious humor of George Garrison
Hinsdale’s remark. “Of course he did
live without me until he discovered me.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t live without you either, Mary
dear,” Rachel assured her.</p>

<p>“No indeed we couldn’t, you Perfect Patron,”
added Madeline. “And that reminds
me that if you don’t hustle around and do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>something nice for the Tally-ho right away,
you’ll be expelled from the society.”</p>

<p>“There’s no rule about how often you have
to do things,” declared Mary indignantly,
“and anyway I can’t be expelled when I’m
the only member. It’s too utterly absurd.”</p>

<p>“Is the Perfect Patrons a society?” demanded
Christy eagerly. “Can’t we join?
It’s not limited to faculty’s wives, is it?”</p>

<p>“Rules for the Perfect Patron,” chanted
Madeline impressively. “Rule one: Only
the prettiest and best-dressed faculty wife existing
at Harding is eligible. Rule two: In
estimating Perfection patronizing the firm is
counted against patronizing the menu. That’s
where little Mary always meets her Waterloo.”</p>

<p>“I do not, and anyway those rules aren’t
half so funny as the real ones that you made
up first,” interpolated Mary sweetly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve forgotten the real ones. Anyway,
we don’t need Perfect Patrons nowadays
as much as we did when we were young and
poor, instead of prosperous and almost too elegant.
So suppose we attend to the organization
of the B. C. A.’s.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>“Is that a society, too?” demanded Helen
the practical.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a cult,” explained Madeline
curtly.</p>

<p>“What’s a cult?”</p>

<p>“What does it stand for?”</p>

<p>“We’re all ‘Merry Hearts.’ What’s the
use of any more clubs?”</p>

<p>Madeline met the avalanche of questions
calmly.</p>

<p>“A cult is a highly exclusive club&mdash;nothing
vulgar and common about a cult, like the
Perfect Patrons’ Society, with its crowded
membership list. As for the B. C. A. part,
you can take a turn at guessing that. If any
one gets it right we shall know that it’s too
easy and that we’d better change to Greek
letters or something. When you’ve guessed
what it’s the cult of, of course you’ll understand
the object of organizing it.”</p>

<p>“Very lucid indeed,” said Christy solemnly.</p>

<p>“Don’t try your patronizing faculty airs on
me,” Madeline warned her. “I may say in
passing that in my humble opinion no
faculty should be caught belonging to a nice
frivolous affair like the ‘Merry Hearts.’ A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>kindly desire not to exclude our faculty
friends of 19&mdash; from our councils was of
course my chief object in promoting the more
dignified cult of the B. C. A.’s.”</p>

<p>“B. C. A.&mdash;Betty Can’t Argue.” Mary, who
had been lost in thought, burst out with her
solution. “She can’t, you know. She always
smiles and says, ‘I don’t know why I think
so, but I do.’”</p>

<p>“Beans Cooked Admirably,” suggested
Emily. “Then the obvious entertainment
would be Saturday suppers à la Boston.”</p>

<p>“Butter Costs Awfully,” amended Christy.
“Then the obvious procedure would be to
open a savings account.”</p>

<p>“Better Come Again,” was Rachel’s contribution.
“That sounds nice and sociable and
Madelineish.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment. You’re getting
the least little speck of a bit warm,”
Madeline told her encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Brilliant Collegians’ Association,” interposed
Betty eagerly. “That must be right,
because you’re all brilliant but me, and I’m
the exception that proves it. Have I guessed,
Madeline?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Madeline shook her head. “Certainly not.
Brilliance should be seen, not heard, Betty,
my child. Besides, according to my well-known
theory of names, a good one should
bring out subtle, unsuspected qualities. That’s
why editors get so excited, and even annoyed,
about the titles of my stories; they aren’t
generally subtle enough themselves to get my
subtle points.”</p>

<p>“Well, I may say that I sympathize with
the editors,” declared Mary feelingly. “Hurry
and give a guess, Helen Chase, and then
maybe she’ll tell us.”</p>

<p>“Bromides Can’t Attend,” said Helen
timidly. “I suppose that’s wrong too.”</p>

<p>“Wildly,” Madeline assured her.</p>

<p>“And also senseless, I should say,” added
Mary. “What in the world are Bromides?”</p>

<p>“People who ask foolish questions,” explained
Christy, “like that one you’ve just
propounded. The others are Sulphites. Get
the book from Helen, who had it presented
to her to read on the train, and then you’ll
know all about it. Now, Madeline, tell us
quick.”</p>

<p>Madeline shrugged her shoulders and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>stirred her tea with a provoking air of
leisureliness. “It’s nothing to get excited
about. Really, after all your ingenious
guesses, the humble reality sounds very tame
and obvious. We are the B. C. A.’s&mdash;the
Back-to-the-College Again’s. It sounds simple,
but like all my titles it involves deep subtleties.
Why are we, of all the 19&mdash;’s who
would give their best hats to be here,
‘elected’ to honor Harding with our presence?
What have we in common? The
answer is of course the sign of the cult and
the mark of eligibility. It’s rather late to-day,
so probably we’d better postpone the discussion
until the next weekly tea-drinking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do we have weekly tea-drinkings?”
asked Christy. “Goodie! now tell our fortunes,
Madeline.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a lot more fun than a silly old
discussion,” said Betty, holding out her cup.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Betty,” interrupted the
methodical Rachel. “She hasn’t told us the
object of the cult yet.”</p>

<p>Madeline swept the circle with a despairing
glance. “As if perfectly good tea and talking
about that ever-interesting subject, Ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
wasn’t ‘object’ enough for anybody.
But you can have an ‘object’ if you like. I
don’t mind, only you know I always did
refuse to get excited over objects and causes
and all that sort of thing.” Madeline
reached for Betty’s cup, and promptly discovered
a tall, fair-haired “suitor” in the
bottom of it. “He has an object,” she declared.
“Can you guess what it is? It’s
Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure Betty’s a worthy object for
any suitor or any cult,” Rachel declared. “If
you don’t believe it, watch her blush.”</p>

<p>“I’m not blushing,” Betty defended herself
vigorously. “I’m only thinking&mdash;thinking
how nice it would be if the B.C.A.’s would
take me for an object. I shall need lots of
help and advice, and maybe other things, and
I shall make you give them to me anyway, so
you’d better elect me to be your object, and
then you won’t mind so much.”</p>

<p>“I shall be much relieved, for my part,”
declared Madeline. “An object with yellow
curls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a dimple,” put in Mary.</p>

<p>“Isn’t likely to be very much of a bore,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>Madeline finished, and turned her attention
to tea-grounds again, discovering so many
suitors, European trips, and splendid presents,
that Christy, who was house teacher at the
Westcott, disgraced herself by being late to
dinner. As for Mary Brooks Hinsdale, in the
excitement of recounting it all to her husband,
she utterly forgot that she had promised
to chaperon the Westcott House dance
and had to be sent for by an irate and anxious
committee, who, however, forgave her
everything when she arrived in her most becoming
pink evening gown, declaring fervently
that she should be heart-broken if she
couldn’t dance every single number.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GRASSHOPPER WAGER</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two weeks after college opened were
the most confused, crowded, delightful, and
difficult ones that Betty Wales had ever lived
through. There seemed to be twice as many
freshmen as there had ever been in Harding
before. The town swarmed with them and
with their proud and anxious fathers and
mothers and sisters and aunts. They fell
upon the Tally-ho Tea-Shop with such ardor
that Emily was in despair&mdash;or would have
been if Betty hadn’t assumed charge of the
dinner hour herself and adroitly impressed
Madeline with the literary value of seeing
life from the cashier’s desk at lunch time.</p>

<p>Miss Dick’s school opened a fortnight after
Harding, and then there was Dorothy to meet&mdash;the
Bensons had brought her east with them
on their way to New York&mdash;and the little
girl was to be established this time in the
boarding department, to the arrangements of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>which she immediately took a perverse dislike.
Considering that she was the youngest boarder
and the pet and darling of the whole school,
this seemed quite unreasonable, particularly
as all the year before she had teased to be a
“boarder.” But Eugenia Ford took most of
this worry off Betty’s hands, getting up early
every morning to go over for a before-breakfast
story, told while she combed out the Smallest
Sister’s tangled curls, and never forgetting to
appear in the evening at the exactly right
minute to deliver a good-night kiss.</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me, please,” she begged Betty
imploringly. “Feeling as if I had to do it
makes her seem a little more like my very
own. Just think!” Eugenia’s eyes filled,
but she went on bravely. “I might be doing
it for my very own little sister, if a dreadful
French ‘bonne’ hadn’t been careless about a
cold she took. How can mothers ever care
more about having dinner parties and dances
and going to the opera, Miss Wales, than
about playing with their babies and seeing
that they’re all right? My mother is like
Peter Pan, I think. She will never grow up.
And she never liked dolls when she was little,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>so naturally she didn’t care to play with us.”
Eugenia flushed, suddenly realizing that she
was indulging in rather strange confidences.
“My mother is a great beauty, Miss Wales,
and awfully bright and entertaining. I’m
very, very proud of her. And if Dorothy is
the least bit sick or tired or unhappy on a
day when you don’t see her, I’ll be sure to
notice and tell you, so you can feel perfectly
safe.”</p>

<p>Of course the greatest problem, and one
that nobody but Betty could do much to cope
with, was the launching of the secretaryship.
The secretary had been provided with a cozy
little office, very businesslike with its roller-topped
desk, a big filing cabinet, and a typewriter
stand, tucked away in a corner of the
Main Building; but beyond that the trustful
directors apparently expected her to shift for
herself. Betty promptly interviewed the two
faculty members of the board, who smiled at
her eagerness and anxiety to please, and advised
her not to be in a hurry, but to begin
with the obvious routine work&mdash;that meant
interviewing and investigating the needs and
the deserts of the girls who had applied for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>loans from the Student’s Aid&mdash;and to branch
out gradually later, as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>“But I can’t do just that,” Betty told the
second B. C. A. tea-drinking, “because it’s no
more than they did themselves before they
had a secretary. It would be like stealing to
take their money for just that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” advised Madeline
lazily. “If they want to make it a snap
course, isn’t that entirely their affair?”</p>

<p>“Why, Madeline Ayres,” objected Helen
Adams solemnly, “it’s a charitable enterprise.
I don’t suppose snap courses are exactly
wrong, though they never amount to much,
and so they waste the time of the ones that
take them. But it would be positively wrong
for the Student’s Aid to waste its money,
when so many more poor girls want educations
than can have them.”</p>

<p>Madeline listened, frowning intently.
“‘The Immorality of the Snap Course’&mdash;I’ll
do a little essay on that for the alumnæ department
of the ‘Argus.’ It will rattle the
editor awfully, but she will almost have to
print it, after having teased and teased me for
a few words from my facile and distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>pen. Thanks a lot, Helen, for the idea. I’d
give you the credit in a foot-note, only it
might scare girls away from your courses.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you thankful, girls,” began Mary,
waving her teacup majestically around the
circle, “that only one of us is a literary light?
I wonder if real authors are as everlastingly
given to changing the subject back to their
own affairs as is our beloved Madeline. Now
let’s get down to business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried Madeline. “Little
Mary will now voice her own and George
Garrison Hinsdale’s sentiments on the immorality
of the snap course. Lend me a
pencil, somebody, so I can take notes of her
valued ideas.”</p>

<p>“The business,” continued Mary, scornfully
ignoring the interruption, “is to find
more work for Betty, so she can earn her
munificent salary properly. The meeting is
now open for suggestions.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mary, fire away,” ordered Madeline
briskly. “Of course a person with your head
for business is simply overflowing with brilliant
thoughts.”</p>

<p>“You think you’re being sarcastic, but just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>the same,” declared Mary modestly, “I have
got a head for business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Witness the way you used to make your
accounts balance when you were in college,
and the way your allowance lasted,” put in
Rachel laughingly.</p>

<p>Mary smiled reminiscently. “My dear
Rachel, a head for business is entirely different
from being able to remember what
you’ve spent. And even if I remembered, I
couldn’t add it all up. But that’s bookkeeping,
not business. As for using up my allowance
ahead of time, I’m naturally an expansionist,
and where would any respectable
business be, may I ask you, if it didn’t go out
every now and then and get more capital to
expand with? I expanded the possibilities
of the Harding course, and my father paid
the bills; unfortunately there are always
bills,” concluded Mary with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Do you still finish your allowance on the
fourth of the month?” demanded Christy.</p>

<p>Mary shook her pretty head smilingly.
“Never&mdash;for the good and sufficient reason
that George Garrison Hinsdale understands
me too well to give me an allowance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“The business of this meeting,” chanted
Madeline sonorously, “is not, as you might
suppose, a discussion of little Mary’s domestic
and financial affairs.”</p>

<p>“Well, the girls asked me questions,” declared
Mary indignantly, “and I didn’t know
that there was any such awful rush. I’m not
trying to gain time while I think up an inspiration,
as you&mdash;well, I won’t start any more
quarrels. I’ll only say that I’m not delaying
in hopes of having an idea for Betty, because
I’ve already got one. I think she ought to
advertise.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Sounds as if she was a breakfast food or a
patent medicine.”</p>

<p>“She’s an employment bureau at present,”
explained Mary serenely, “and when Morton
Hall is ready to open she’ll be a house agent.
She’s got to let people know that the bulletin-board
in the gym basement is a back member,
because she has it beaten cold. She impersonates
the great and only link between the talented poor
and the idle rich in this community.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“That sounds well,” admitted Christy,
“but how in the world is she to do it&mdash;be the
great and only link, I mean?”</p>

<p>Mary shrugged her shoulders, and began
putting on her gloves, which were new and
fitted beautifully. “I leave all that to you,”
she said. “I really must go now. Miss
Ferris is having an intellectual dinner party
for a philosopher from Boston, and we’re
asked. I always make a point of wearing my
prettiest things to their intellectual dinners&mdash;it’s
the least and the most that I can do&mdash;and
one’s prettiest things do take ages to get into.
Good-bye, my dears.”</p>

<p>“She’s hit it, as usual,” said Rachel admiringly,
when Mary’s trim little figure had
rustled out of sight. “The important thing
to do is to make the girls realize what you’re
here for. Most of them know that you’re the
new Student’s Aid secretary&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But they don’t know how to use you in
their business,” Christy took her up.</p>

<p>“And the ones that need you most will
always be too scared,” put in Helen Adams
earnestly. “When I was a junior”&mdash;she
blushed a little at her tardy admission&mdash;“my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>mother lost some money, and we didn’t have
as much interest to live on. I thought I
might have to leave college, and I wondered
if the Student’s Aid would help me to stay.
But I was too scared to ask. I started twice
to go and see one of the faculty directors, but
I just couldn’t screw up my courage. And
then mother sold a farm that she’d wanted to
get rid of for years, so it was all right. But&mdash;well,
I wasn’t ashamed to ask for help; I was
just scared,” ended Helen incoherently.</p>

<p>“Results of investigation up to date,” began
Emily, who was dividing her time between
the cashier’s desk and the B. C. A.’s table.
“First, let people know what you are here for;
secondly, take away the scared feeling from
girls, who, as well as you can guess, may need
help; third&mdash;this is original with me&mdash;get the
girls who have money properly excited about
having things done for them. I can tell you,
I used to bless the B’s for the sentiment
they created in favor of hiring somebody to
sew on skirt braids and mend stockings.”</p>

<p>“Well, the B’s aren’t the only ones who
can create sentiments,” said Madeline. “Georgia’s
very good at it, and the Dutton twins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>are regular geniuses. Fluffy Dutton could
make people so wildly enthusiastic over the
binomial theorem that they’d be ready to die
for it if she asked them to.”</p>

<p>“Then get them started on Betty,” ordered
Rachel.  “Madeline Ayres is hereby elected
to enthuse all the champion enthusers on the
subject of the enjoyability of being mended
up by somebody else.”</p>

<p>Madeline bowed gravely. “I hereby accept
the chairmanship of the committee on Proper
Excitement of the Idle Rich, and I would
suggest Rachel Morrison as chairman of the
committee on Proper Encouragement of the
Timid Poor, and Christy Mason to head one
on Proper Exploitation of Miss Betty Wales,
the eager, earnest, and insufficiently employed
Student’s Aid Secretary.”</p>

<p>“If I might humbly suggest something at
this point,” laughed Christy, “it would be
that Betty might like to invent her own
committees and choose the chairmen of
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed,” cried Betty heartily.
“You all have such splendid ideas and Madeline
has such lovely names for things. Please
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>go on and think of something else. I haven’t
dared to say a word all this time, because I
was so afraid that you would stop.”</p>

<p>“That’s the proper spirit for an Object.”
Madeline patted Betty’s shoulder encouragingly.
“Accept the goods the B. C. A.’s
provide. Instead of not earning your salary,
my child, you’re going to give the Student’s
Aid the biggest kind of a bargain. Besides
one small secretary (with curls and a dimple)
they’re getting the invaluable assistance of at
least six prominent graduates, and any
number of influential college girls. If that’s
not a run for their money, I should like to
know what they want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they haven’t acted dissatisfied,” explained
Betty hastily. “It was only I that
was worried.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like to know what you
want, then,” amended Madeline with severity.
Then she smiled a self-satisfied little smile.
“It’s all right to ask ‘What’s in a name?’
There’s nothing much in some names, but if
these committees of mine aren’t rather extra
popular on account of their stylish headings,
I shall stop trying to make a reputation for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>clever titles and devote my life to producing
horrible commonplaces for the Woman’s Page
of the Sunday papers. I’m going up to the
campus this minute to talk to Georgia and
Fluffy Dutton. Come along, Rachel, and get
your committee started too.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Madeline,” Emily broke
in. “Why not organize a sort of council of
all the committees, and have a meeting of it
here some afternoon next week to talk over
the situation?”</p>

<p>Madeline stared at her sadly. “If you
think I’m going to spoil my perfectly good
committee by asking it to meet, you don’t
understand the first principles of my sweet
and simple nature. The last way to properly
excite people is to hold stupid meetings.
Come along, Rachel, before my beautiful
enthusiasm vanishes.”</p>

<p>The next morning Fluffy Dutton appeared
in “Psych. 6” ten minutes after the hour,
with a yard of black mohair braid trailing
conspicuously from her note-book.</p>

<p>The lecture was hopelessly dull, and the
class concentrated its wandering attention
on the braid which, with a notice pinned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>to one end, traveled slowly up and down the
room.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For those wishing to be neat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here’s a plan that can’t be beat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pin your name upon this braid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll a needy student aid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell her where and when to call</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she’ll do it&mdash;that is all.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She’ll rip the old braid, sew on new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prompt return your skirt to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So read the rhyming notice, and below it was
printed in large letters, “Lowest Prices for all
Repairing, Mending, and Plain Sewing (including
Gym Suits).”</p>

<p>When the strip of braid got back to Fluffy
it looked like the tail of a kite, with its collection
of orders scattered artistically up and
down its length.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wrote the rhyme,” Fluffy admitted
modestly, when the class was dismissed.
“Wrote it between breakfast and chapel.
What made me late to Psych. was buying the
braid. Georgia wrote one too, and we are racing
each other to see who gets the largest
number of orders. Oh, yes, I suppose they do
need the work&mdash;or the money rather. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>the thing that appeals to me is the impression
I shall make on my mother when I go home
all neat and tidy and mended up for once.
Haven’t you a freshman sister? Well, put
her down for a gym suit, that’s a dear!
Georgia’s going to catch me a dozen grasshoppers
if I win. I hate catching things so&mdash;my
hair always blows in my eyes.”</p>

<p>“And what if Georgia wins?”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I’ve got to catch her a dozen
grasshoppers,” said Fluffy resignedly. “But
I don’t care much, because I shall hire it done,
and that will be all for the good of the cause.
But I can’t believe that she will win, because
gym suits count as three skirt braids, and
positions for waitresses count as five. I’m going
to get a lot of those from eleven to twelve.
Georgia is furious because this is her lab.
morning, and she can’t get a good start.”
And Fluffy trailed her skirt braid over to
Junior Lit. where she got so many orders that
she had to unpin them, place them on file, so
to speak, in the front of her shirt-waist, and
start over.</p>

<p>It may be reprehensible to wager grasshoppers;
but, as Fluffy pointed out to some humane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
friend, they were doomed in any case,
and there was a piquant flavor of adventure
about the whole proceeding that appealed
strongly to one type of the Harding mind.
The committee on the Encouragement (and
discovery) of the Timid Poor convened hastily
that same evening in Betty’s shiny new office,
and discovered that while their day’s work
had necessarily been less spectacular than
their rivals’, it had been equally effective.
There would be no trouble in matching workers
to skirt braids.</p>

<p>“But there’ll be all kinds of trouble about
flunked courses,” announced Eugenia Ford
solemnly, “unless we remember to pay better
attention in ‘Psych. 6.’ He gave out a written
lesson for to-morrow on purpose, because
there was so much whispering and rustling
around to-day.”</p>

<p>“The more flunking, the more tutoring,”
suggested a pretty junior, and blushed very
pink when she remembered that Rachel Morrison
was on the faculty.</p>

<p>“That was a foolish remark,” she added
apologetically. “For my part, I honestly
think there’ll be less flunking than usual. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>makes you more in earnest about your own college
course when you see how some girls value
it, and what they’ll sacrifice to get it. Come
along, Eugenia, and let’s begin to burn the
midnight oil.”</p>

<span class="smaller">REINFORCEMENTS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> initiation of Babbie Hildreth, which
had to be over in time for the participants to
meet Eleanor Watson’s train, was the feature
of the next B. C. A. tea-drinking, held two
days ahead of time in honor of the double reinforcement
to the ranks of 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re all satisfied. I’ve come up
here out of pure curiosity about this old cult,”
announced Babbie, when they were settled
cozily in Flying Hoof’s stall. “You all wrote
the most maddening letters&mdash;it was arranged,
I know, what each one should say, so that I’d
keep getting crazier and crazier to be let into
the secret.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you rather want to see your elegant
new tea-shop?” demanded Rachel innocently.</p>

<p>“Ye-es”&mdash;Babbie flushed,&mdash;“of course I
did. It’s lovely, isn’t it? Nora must appreciate
her splendid kitchen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you haven’t seen the kitchen yet,
Babbie,” cried Helen Adams reproachfully.
“I’ve been with you every minute since you
came.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can guess what it’s like, can’t I?”
Babbie defended herself.</p>

<p>“Babbie Hildreth,” demanded Madeline,
sternly, “when were you up here last?”</p>

<p>“In August,” Babbie admitted sulkily, “if
you must know. My Aunt Belinda brought
me up in her car.” She brightened in spite
of herself. “Aunt Belinda is so lovely and
romantic. She thinks it’s all right for me to
come up and see Robert, since he can’t come
very often to see me. Mother doesn’t, exactly.
But she was terribly amused at this
B. C. A. cult. She told me to run along
and satisfy my ‘satiable curiosity’ if I
wanted to. I&mdash;oh, excuse me one minute,
please!”</p>

<p>Having thoughtfully secured a seat at the
end of the stall, Babbie had been the first to
observe a dark object in the act of vaulting
the Tally-ho’s back fence. She intercepted
the dark object on the front walk, and accompanied
it forthwith to Paradise, where the tea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>and marmalade that you hunger for and the
curiosity that you feel about mysterious
“cults” may both, under favorable circumstances,
be forgotten as utterly as if they had
never been.</p>

<p>So the B. C. A.’s amused themselves by
inventing some stunning “features” for a
formal initiation ceremony to be held later for
Eleanor and Babbie together, ate Babbie’s
share of the muffins and jam, congratulated
themselves on the way they had “set Betty
up in business,” as Mary Brooks modestly put
it, and waited so long for their beloved
“Object” to appear&mdash;it was an office-hours
afternoon, and Betty had refused to desert her
post even for a B. C. A. tea-drinking&mdash;that
they had to run all the way to the station,
only to discover, on arriving there breathless
and disheveled, that the train was an hour
late.</p>

<p>“So we might just as well have preserved
the dignity of the Harding faculty and wives,”
sighed Mary, straightening her new fall hat.
“It’s all your fault, Betty Wales. You said
you’d come in time to go to the train, and we
kept thinking you’d arrive upon the scene
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>every single minute. And the longer we
waited the more we ate, and then the harder
it was to run.”</p>

<p>“Some one came in to see me just at the
last minute,” Betty explained. “I couldn’t
say that I had an engagement when it was
just larks.”</p>

<p>Betty let the cult and its friends get all the
orders they would for skirt braids and gym
suits, and all possible data about needy girls;
but she never confided in them, in return&mdash;a
conservative attitude which Madeline considered
“distinctly snippy.”</p>

<p>“I just know you’re concealing all sorts of
stunning short stories about your person,” she
declared. “Now Bob tells me lovely things
about her fresh-air kids. She isn’t such a
clam.”</p>

<p>But Betty was equally impervious to being
called a clam and to fulfilling her obligations
toward Madeline’s Literary Career. The
humor and the pathos that came into the secretary’s
office she regarded as state secrets, to
be never so much as hinted at, even to her
dearest friends.</p>

<p>“But it sometimes seems as if I should just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>burst with it all,” she told Jim Watson, who
poked his head in her door nearly every day,
and rapidly withdrew it again if any one else
was with her. “It isn’t only the girls who
come on regular business that are so queer,
but the ones that come just for advice.
Eugenia Ford has the strangest ideas about
my being able to straighten things out, and
she’s told her crowd, and they’ve told their
friends. Every day some girl walks in and
says, ‘Are you the one who will answer questions?’
Then I say who I am, and suggest
that maybe she wants her class officer. But
she says no, she means me; and maybe she’s
a freshman who has decided that she can’t
live another day without her collie dog, and
maybe she’s a senior, who has cut too much
and is frightened silly about being sent home,
and maybe she’s a pretty, muddle-headed
little sophomore who’s in love with a Winsted
man and doesn’t dare tell her father and
mother, and is thinking of eloping. Oh, Jim,
these are just possible cases, you understand,
not real ones. But you mustn’t ever breathe
a word of what I’ve said.”</p>

<p>“I’m as silent as a tomb,” Jim would assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
her gravely each time that something
too nearly “real” slipped out.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re the only one I ever do burst
out to,” Betty assured him, “except when I
decide that it’s only right to ask Miss Ferris
or Prexy or some responsible person like
them for advice. I don’t know why I should
talk so much more about it to you, except
that you don’t know any of the girls and
never will, whereas Madeline would be sure
to write up anything funny that she heard,
and Rachel and Christy and Helen are on the
faculty and the girls who come to see me
might be in their classes, and if Emily Davis
knew she’d want terribly to tell the rest.”</p>

<p>“All girls are leaky,” Jim would announce
sententiously at this point in the argument.
“Besides, I’ve been a secretary myself. My
job was exactly the same as yours in the
matter of holding confidential information.
Now when are you coming over to see about
that linen closet?”</p>

<p>It was really not at all surprising, considering
how highly Jasper J. Morton valued her
opinion, that his architectural representative
found it necessary to consult Betty Wales almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
every day on some problem growing out
of the peculiar adaptabilities and arrangements
of Morton Hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The B. C. A.’s paced the station platform
till they were tired, and then they further
outraged the dignity of the “faculty and
wives” by sitting down to rest on a baggage
truck, and swinging their feet off the edge.
It was thus that Jim, who had taken the precaution
to telephone the ticket agent before
leaving home, found them a few minutes before
Eleanor’s arrival.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Do make yourselves as fascinating as you
can,” he implored them all naïvely, “so
she’ll stay. She’s been taking singing lessons
lately at home, and her teacher had a New
York teacher visiting her, and both of them
got excited about Eleanor’s voice. So now
she’s written about some crazy plan she has
for a winter in New York, studying music.
That’s all right after Christmas, maybe, but
at present I want her right here, and the person
who can make her see it that way wins
my everlasting gratitude.”</p>

<p class="p2">“You’ll be likely to win your own everlasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
gratitude, I should say,” Madeline
told him. “Eleanor was always expatiating
on the charms of her brother Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim blushed. “That’s all right, but I
have a feeling that she’s keener about some
other fellow’s charms by this time. Plenty
of fellows are certainly keen about hers. But
lately she doesn’t pay any attention to
them&mdash;just goes in for slumming and improving
her mind, and now her voice. So
give her a good time, and get her excited
about your mysterious club, and when she
begins on the earnestness of life and the self-improvement
business, ring in all Miss
Betty’s philanthropies. And I’ll come in
strong on the lonely brother act. I say,
there she is this minute!”</p>

<p>Jim gave a running jump on to the platform
of a passing car and had his innings
while the girls, taken unaware, scrambled
down from their truck and hurried after him.</p>

<p>It didn’t seem as if it would be hard to
keep Eleanor. There was the little awkward
moment at first, that even the best of friends
experience when they haven’t seen each other
for over a year; and then such a babel of talk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>and laughter, of questions asked all at once
and never answered, of explanations interrupted
by exclamations, and rendered wholly
incoherent by hugs and kisses.</p>

<p>“You haven’t changed a bit,” they told
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have! You’re prettier than
ever.”</p>

<p>“When will you sing for us?”</p>

<p>“Have you done any writing lately?”</p>

<p>“Are you too tired to see the Tally-ho
right away?”</p>

<p>“You’re to live in Rachel’s little white
house, you know, and we’re all quarreling
about when we can have you for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Picnics! I should think so. As many
as you want.”</p>

<p>“Don’t those infants make the absurdest
imitations of faculties?”</p>

<p>“How do you like little Mary’s new
hat?”</p>

<p>They walked up Main Street chattering like
magpies and forgetting to turn out for anybody,
Jim bringing up the rear with Eleanor’s
suit case in one hand and a book of Babbie’s
and an untidy bundle of manuscript that Madeline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
had dropped in her excitement tucked
under the other arm.</p>

<p>Christy invited the whole party to dinner
at the Tally-ho, and they decided that it was
quite warm enough to eat in the top story of
the Peter Pan annex. Jim had lighted all
the Chinese lanterns and hauled up two
baskets full of dinner, while the girls chattered
merrily on as if they never meant to
stop, when Babbie and Mr. Thayer appeared,
sauntering slowly down the hill from the direction
of Paradise. They didn’t seem at all
ashamed of the way Babbie had been snatched
away from her own initiation party, but shouted
up that they were simply starved to death, and
cheerfully assuming that there was dinner
enough and room enough for all comers, they
annexed themselves to Christy’s party.</p>

<p>“You’re lucky to have a sister to look after
you,” Mr. Thayer told Jim. “I opened a big
club-house for my mill people last winter,
just to please these young ladies, and how do
they pay me? By cold, cruel neglect.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Madeline contradicted him
cheerfully. “We gave you a splendid start.
That’s all we do for anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“We’re all so busy,” Betty added quickly.
“But we are just as interested as we ever were.
Isn’t the girl I sent you managing well?”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer nodded. “Only she can’t seem
to discover a genius who’s able to take hold
of the prize class.”</p>

<p>“Is that the one my adorable Rafael is
in?” demanded Madeline. “Because if it
is, I might&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is, but you can’t have it,” Babbie told
her firmly. “They changed teachers four
times last year, after you dropped them so
unceremoniously. This time they’re to have
some one who will stick, aren’t they, Robert?”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer looked uncomfortable, not wishing
either to contradict Babbie or to slight
Madeline’s offer. “It’s better, of course, but
perhaps Miss Madeline will stick this time.”</p>

<p>“Robert!” Babbie’s tone was very hopeless.
“Can’t you understand that Madeline is about
as likely to stick as Prexy is to dance a hornpipe
at to-morrow’s chapel?” She sighed
deeply. “It must be terrible to be a reformer;
you have to be so hopeful about
people’s turning over a new leaf&mdash;whether
it’s Madeline sticking, or a dreadful old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>Frenchman beating his wife, or the angelic-looking
Rafael learning his alphabet.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t they learned that yet?” asked
Madeline incredulously.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” retorted Babbie. “You
jabbered Italian all the time to them, and
that spoiled them so that they never would
study for the other teachers.”</p>

<p>“I regret my reprehensible familiarity with
their mother tongue,” announced Madeline
grandiloquently, “and I hereby make due
reparation.” Her glance wandered around
the table. “I elect Eleanor Watson to take
the prize class.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” Eleanor asked. “I
don’t understand at all. I didn’t know there
were any foreigners in Harding.”</p>

<p>So they told her about Factory Hill, about
Young-Man-Over-the-Fence and his Twelfth-Night
party that accidentally started the fund
for the club-house, about the education clause
in the new factory laws, the club organization,
which was now so efficiently managed by the
Student’s Aid’s prize beneficiary&mdash;a senior
who had earned every bit of her college
course&mdash;and finally about Rafael and Giuseppi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and Pietro and the other Italian boys,
who scorned their French and Polish, Portuguese
and German comrades, and insisted
upon their own little club&mdash;a concession in
return for which they played truant, refused
to study or pay attention, and quarreled violently
on the slightest provocation. They
would have to be dropped from the factory
pay-roll, according to the new law, if they
did not speedily mend their ways and learn
to read and write.</p>

<p>“Why, I should be almost afraid to be left
alone with them,” Eleanor exclaimed at the
end of the recital. “Do they carry daggers?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not quite so barbaric as that,”
Mr. Thayer told her. “They are just lively
boys, who’ve been brought up with strong
race prejudices and no chance to have the
jolly good times that would make them forget
their feuds and revolts. They work hard
because their fathers make them, and because
it’s the regular way of living for them. But
being forced to study they consider the most
bitter tyranny. The factory inspectors have
had their cases up twice now, and if I can’t
make a good report on them at Christmas I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>shall have to let them go. I hate to, because
they can’t get other work here, and if they
leave their homes and friends, nine out of the
ten will probably go straight to the bad.”</p>

<p>“There’s your chance, Eleanor,” Jim told
her eagerly.</p>

<p>“But, Jim, I can’t ‘stick,’ as Babbie calls
it. I’m here only for a little visit. My
music&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go down every week for a lesson,” Jim
ordered easily. “Don’t miss a chance at a
ripping New England autumn with all this
good society thrown in.”</p>

<p>“Even if you’re not staying long, do take
them off my hands for a few weeks,” begged
Mr. Thayer. “They’re afraid of me and sulk
stupidly if I try to teach them, and they’ve
been rather too much for any of the girls
who’ve tried.”</p>

<p>“Then what makes you think&mdash;&mdash;” began
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“You’ve been elected, Eleanor,” Madeline
broke in impatiently. “That settles it. You
can manage them the way you managed
that newsboys’ club in Denver. Oh, I’ve
heard&mdash;&mdash;” as Eleanor flushed and protested.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>“That’s why I elected you. Now we want
some songs. Where’s her guitar, Monsieur
Jacques? If Rafael won’t learn the alphabet
any other way, you can sing it to him.”</p>

<p>So Eleanor laughingly consented to meet
the Terrible Ten, as Babbie called them, the
next night, and the Ten won her heart, as Jim
had hoped they would.</p>

<p>Eleanor never mentioned the alphabet.
She merely inquired of the circle of dark
faces who had heard of Robin Hood, and receiving
only sullen negatives, she began a
story. One by one the sullen faces grew
eager. At a most exciting point, where
Robin and his band were on the point of playing
a fine joke on the Sheriff of Nottingham,
she stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” she said. “That’s all for to-night.”</p>

<p>“You tella more next day?” demanded the
graceless Rafael. He had fairly drowned out
the first part of the tale with muttered threats
upon Pietro, who had hidden his cap.</p>

<p>Eleanor hesitated diplomatically. “Would
you really like to hear the rest?” she asked
finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Rafael’s brown eyes met hers, clouded with
supreme indifference, and his expressive
shoulders shrugged coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Then what will you do for me? You
can’t expect me to amuse you big boys the
whole evening, while you do nothing to
amuse me in return. This is a club, you
know. In a club everybody does something
for everybody else.”</p>

<p>“What you like?” demanded Rafael, with
suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>“Yes, what you like?” echoed Pietro, the
quarrel between them quite forgotten.</p>

<p>“I’m very fond of pictures,” announced
Eleanor gravely. “If you’d each draw a picture
of Robin Hood on the blackboard over
there&mdash;here are a lot of colored chalks&mdash;and
put his name under it&mdash;Robin, we’ll call him
for short&mdash;why, I should think you’d done
your full share.”</p>

<p>The Terrible Ten exchanged bewildered
glances, and one after another slouched nonchalantly
to the chalk box. The colored
crayons were a novelty, nine of the Terrible
Ten were born artists, and the tenth&mdash;Rafael,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>whose crushed hand was still stiff and awkward&mdash;was
pathetically anxious to satisfy the
new teacher’s strange demands. His Robin
Hood looked like a many colored smutch, with
a sprawling green frame around it&mdash;that was
Sherwood forest, thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the name,” Eleanor reminded
them calmly, when, the pictures finished, the
artists began to exchange furtive glances
again in regard to the next requirement.</p>

<p>“You make lil’ sample on mine,” suggested
Rafael craftily.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll make one up here,” Eleanor
amended, “where everybody can see it.”</p>

<p>And to her surprise the Terrible Ten, with
many sighs and grimaces, and much smutting
out of mistakes with wetted fingers, toilsomely
accomplished the writing.</p>

<p>“Now,” Eleanor said, “let’s talk for a while
before we go home. There’s a bag of peanuts
under my coat. Will you bring it, please,
Pietro?” She took the bag and grouped the
boys around the long table. “Now let’s play
a game while we eat. I’ll ask questions, and
the one that answers quickest gets some
peanuts. Listen now: if I give Pietro six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>peanuts and Giovanni five, how many will
that be?”</p>

<p>Dazed looks on the faces of the Ten, followed
by anxious finger-counting.</p>

<p>“Fifteen,” hazarded Pietro.</p>

<p>“Nix, nine,” shrieked Rafael.</p>

<p>Giuseppi got it right, and to make sure they
counted at the top of their lungs, while
Eleanor passed him, one by one, the eleven
peanuts.</p>

<p>“Now, if he gives Pietro two&mdash;&mdash;” began
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Aw, come off. You say you gif to me,”
interrupted Giuseppi. “I wish to keep my
peanuts.”</p>

<p>Eleanor gravely accepted the amendment.
“All right.” She counted out eleven peanuts,
and held them up in her hand. “Now I
have eleven peanuts. If I give Pietro two”&mdash;she
suited the action to the word&mdash;“how many
have I left?”</p>

<p>More frantic finger-counting, and this time
Giovanni got the prize.</p>

<p>Then Rafael and his six unfed comrades
burst into angry protests. “You give Pietro
two for nix. He never guess right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“No fair that he gets some for nix.”</p>

<p>Eleanor met the crisis calmly. “They’re
my peanuts, so I can give him two if I like.
But wait a minute. See what I do now. I
give Rafael two, you two, you two, and you, and
you, and you, and you. How many is that?
The one that guesses right gets as many as all
you boys have together. Quick now.”</p>

<p>Efforts to eat the peanuts and count them
at the same time resulted in absolute pandemonium.</p>

<p>“Let’s have paper,” Eleanor suggested.
“That’s easier than doing it all in your head.”</p>

<p>Before the evening was over the passing out
of peanuts two by two had accomplished the
learning of the “two-times” table, as far as
two times ten.</p>

<p>“Who promises to come next time?” asked
Eleanor, while they waited awkwardly for her
to gather up her wraps.</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“You bet I do.”</p>

<p>“Dis club is O.K.”</p>

<p>“You doan fergit the story?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Not if you’ll all try to remember the ‘two-times’
table,” Eleanor promised, shaking
hands gravely all around.</p>

<p>“She’s de peach fer sure. Gotta all dem oder
teachers beat,” announced Pietro on the steps.</p>

<p>“Don’t you call her no peach. She’s a
lovely lady,” corrected Rafael, aiming a deft
blow with his left hand.</p>

<p>“Ain’t a lada a peach?” challenged Pietro,
dancing out of reach.</p>

<p>“All right for Italian girl, not good enough
for lika her,” Rafael answered fiercely.</p>

<p>“Wonder if she bring more dem peanuts
next week,” speculated Nicolo.</p>

<p>“She ain’t no millionaire, maybe.” Rafael
turned upon him scowling. “But doan you
dare fergit the two-times, ’cause den she’ll
fergit Robin. I killa de kid dat fergits.”</p>

<p>Rafael was evidently the Ten’s leader.
They received his dire threat in awed silence,
and tramped off, chanting the two-times table
with a vigor that reached Eleanor, reporting
her evening’s experiences to Mr. Thayer, and
clinched her wavering determination into a
promise to stay for at least a month in
Harding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Smallest Sister was reconciled at last to
being a boarder.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a new chum,” she announced
eagerly, coming to see her sister on an afternoon
which Betty, feeling more than usually
“caught-up” with her other activities, had
decided to devote to Dorothy.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to Shirley Ware?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>“We’re mad at each other&mdash;at least I’m
mad at Shirley.” The Smallest Sister assumed
an air of injured innocence. “We
don’t speak any more, except to say good-morning
at breakfast if Miss Dick is looking
right at us.”</p>

<p>“But that’s so silly, Dorothy,” Betty protested.
“Shirley is a dear little girl, and if
you’ve quarreled it’s probably more your
fault than hers. Tell me all about it, dearie.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Dorothy began sulkily, “I’d just as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>soon tell you, only Frisky&mdash;that’s Francisca
Fenton, my new chum&mdash;she asked us all
not to say anything more about it. I’m
not the only one that’s mad at Shirley.
Nearly every single girl at Miss Dick’s is too,&mdash;only
being chums with her makes it worse
for me, because I’m so ashamed of her.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Francisca Fenton?” asked
Betty, digressing diplomatically for a moment
from the main issue. “I never even heard
you speak of her before. Haven’t you become
chums very fast?”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded importantly. “She’s one
of the older girls. Maybe you haven’t heard
me speak of her, but I’ve just nearly worshipped
her ever since she came last fall.
The other day when I cried because I was so
mad at Shirley and so ashamed of her, why,
she came and asked me to be chums. Her
chum was in it too, you see. I mean she
took sides with Shirley.”</p>

<p>“Sides about what?” asked Betty innocently.</p>

<p>“About being a tattle-tale, of course,”
Dorothy began, and stopped short, setting her
pretty little mouth in a straight, determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>line. “Frisky asked me not to talk about it,
and I shan’t,” she announced. “So don’t you
try to make me.”</p>

<p>Betty was mending a pair of Dorothy’s
gloves. She stuck the needle into the rip,
folded the gloves, and silently began upon
the holes in her own stockings. Dorothy
pretended to look out the window, but she
kept one eye on Betty, who appeared completely
absorbed in her work.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely day,” the Smallest Sister observed
presently.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we going for our walk pretty
soon?” demanded the Smallest Sister, after a
polite interval.</p>

<p>There was another polite interval, then she
came over to Betty’s chair and repeated her
question. “Didn’t you hear me, Betty? I
asked can’t we go for our walk pretty soon?”</p>

<p>Betty looked at her coldly. “You can go
any time you like,” she said.</p>

<p>“But I’m your company. You asked me
to spend the afternoon, and have supper with
you and Miss Eleanor and Eugenia.”</p>

<p>Betty continued her cold scrutiny of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>Smallest Sister’s small person. “I asked my
nice little sister to supper,” she announced
judicially. “I didn’t ask a silly little girl
who has silly little quarrels with her best
friends, and then won’t talk it over with me
and let me help her straighten it all out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to straighten it out,” muttered
Dorothy defiantly, “and Frisky specially
asked us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not to talk about it in the school,” concluded
Betty. “If she asked you not to talk
about it to your mothers and big sisters, why,
she isn’t a good kind of chum for you. She
can’t be.”</p>

<p>Dorothy flushed an angry pink. “Just
wait till you see her. She’s lovely. She’s
the nicest chum I ever, ever had.”</p>

<p>Betty got up quietly and handed the Smallest
Sister her hat and coat. “You’d better
be going back, I think,” she said very cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Back where?”</p>

<p>“To school, of course, for supper.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” Dorothy interposed hastily.
“Why, I asked Miss Dick for permission
to come and stay with you till the evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
study hour. She’d think it was very
queer for me not to stay.”</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone her and explain,” said
Betty inexorably.</p>

<p>“I shan’t go if you do,” declared the little
rebel. “So now! I shan’t go!”</p>

<p>“Dorothy Wales,” began Betty gravely,
putting one arm around the Smallest Sister’s
waist and drawing her stiff little figure closer,
“if mother were here and you acted this way
you know as well as I do what she’d do.
She’d send you straight to bed to stay all this
lovely long afternoon. Now I’m not mother,
so I can’t do that. It’s not my place. But I
can see that I’ve made a mistake in bringing
you here. I thought you loved me enough to
do as I want&mdash;as I think best, I mean. You
don’t, so I must send you home to mother at
once. Now I want you to go right back to
Miss Dick’s, and tell her that I can’t have
you to tea to-day. You needn’t say why. And
I shall write to mother to-night.”</p>

<p>“But Betty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s no use arguing about it, Dorothy,”
Betty cut her short. “I mean exactly what I
say. Put on your hat at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>A month of being the youngest boarder and
the school pet, supplemented by Eugenia’s
many flattering attentions, had badly spoiled
the Smallest Sister, but she could still recognize
the voice of authority. In an uncomfortable
flash she came to her senses. Her
sister Betty meant what she said. She was
going to be sent back to mother in disgrace.
For a few minutes longer pride sustained her.
Silently she lifted her chin for Betty to draw
the elastic of her hat beneath it. Silently she
stretched out her arms for Betty to pull on
her coat. With only a faint tremor in her
voice she said good-bye, and holding herself
very erect marched out of the room, shutting
the door after herself in a fashion that could
not absolutely be called banging, because then
Betty might tell her to come back and do it
over, but was perilously near that unladylike
mode of procedure.</p>

<p>When she had gone Betty sank down
wearily in her big chair. She was bewildered,
frightened, discouraged. “I didn’t
manage right,” she reflected sadly. “I ought
to have got around her some way. I can’t
bear to send her home. I love to have her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>here so, and then she will feel that it’s a
punishment&mdash;and it is too&mdash;when it’s only
that I have to do it, because I don’t know
how to manage. I’ve tried to do more than I
can. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!” Betty’s
golden head sank down on the arm of the big
chair, and her slender figure shook with her
tears.</p>

<p>It was thus that the Smallest Sister, flying
up the stairs and bursting precipitately into
the room she had left with such dignity,
found her.</p>

<p>“Please go away. I’m t-tired. I’d rather
be let alone,” Betty sobbed, evidently mistaking
the invader for somebody else.</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister hesitated, then her soft
little arms tugged at the prostrate figure.
“Please don’t cry,” she begged. “Please
listen to me, Betty. I know I’ve got to go
home. I haven’t come to tease you to take it
back&mdash;honestly I haven’t. But I’m going to
tell you all about Shirley and Francisca and
me. I’d rather. Please don’t cry any more,
Betty dear.”</p>

<p>Betty sat up, dabbing at her wet cheeks
with a damp handkerchief. Dorothy offered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>her a dry one, and when Betty moved to one
side of the big chair and smoothed down her
skirts invitingly, the Smallest Sister climbed
in beside her. Two in a chair is always the
way to begin to make up.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell you,” she began. “You see
Frisky had a spread for her four roommates
in their study after the lights were out. She
rooms ’way down at the end of the long corridor,
and they shut the door&mdash;that’s against
the rules&mdash;and lit a candle, and trusted to
luck that nobody would see it shining underneath
the door. Miss Carson&mdash;the one we
call Kitty Carson, because she comes along so
still&mdash;is their corridor teacher, and she
doesn’t often bother to go ’way down to that
end, unless there’s a noise. She didn’t that
night, but Shirley woke up and was thirsty
and wanted a drink. And on the way to
where the table with the pitcher of ice-water
is, she got lost, because the hall is pretty
dark, and she saw the light under the door
and knocked, and they started her back the
right way. Next morning she was telling
about it at breakfast, and Kitty Carson heard
her, and asked her all about how she got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>back, and Shirley told every single thing&mdash;about
the spread and who was there and all.
And so now Frisky has to stay in bounds for
two weeks, and she can’t have any candy or a
box from home till after Christmas. Kitty
Carson wrote to say so&mdash;and that’s all, Betty
dear. Frisky said she was sick of the subject,
and not to mention it again, but of course she
never meant not to tell you. I s’pose you
have a good reason to want to know. I’m
sorry you had to cry.”</p>

<p>Betty leaned over and kissed the flushed,
eager little face so close beside hers.
“Thank you for coming back,” she said.
“Now we’re good friends again, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded.</p>

<p>“And do you want to know what I think?”</p>

<p>Another nod.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid you’ve all been very unkind
to Shirley. Have you called her tattle-tale,
and shut her out of all the fun, and
maybe made her cry?”</p>

<p>This time the nod was very emphatic.</p>

<p>“We call her Tattle-tale Shirley. How
did you ever guess that, Betty? And we
don’t associate with her at all. And she cries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>into her pillow at night, because she hears us
whispering secrets and we leave her out. But,
Betty, she ought to have to feel bad. It’s just
mean to tell on another girl. Poor Frisky
has to walk up and down the tennis-courts
alone for her exercise hour, with Kitty Carson
watching out of her window to see that she
does it. But she says she wouldn’t mind that.
What she minds is thinking anybody could
be so hateful that she’d go and tell.”</p>

<p>“But did Shirley mean to tell, or did she
just get frightened and confused and speak
before she thought?”</p>

<p>“Well,” the Smallest Sister admitted reluctantly,
“I s’pose maybe she got rather frightened.
Kitty Carson looks at you so hard
through her big specs that you generally do.
But she had ought to have thought.” Dorothy
was earnest if not grammatical. “Frisky
says she’d sooner be expelled from school herself
than get another girl into disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Frisky, as you call her, is older. Shirley
is little and timid, and I’m sure she didn’t
realize that she was saying anything wrong.
Did she now, Dorothy? Tell me ‘honest
and true,’ what you think. Did she dislike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Frisky, and want to get her into trouble?”</p>

<p>“No-o, I s’pose not. She used to say she
worshipped her just as much as I did.”</p>

<p>“Then do you think it’s quite fair to treat
her as you have?”</p>

<p>“No-o, I guess maybe not. Frisky’s old
chum, that she had before me, said it wasn’t,
but I didn’t s’pose she knew. I’ll tell Frisky
what you think, and I’ll tell Shirley that I
forgive her if she truly didn’t mean it. Of
course I can’t be chums with her again, because
now I’m chums with Frisky. But I
won’t call her tattle-tale any more, and I’ll
tell the others what you think.” The Smallest
Sister sighed and slipped off the chair.
“I guess&mdash;I guess I’d better be going,” she
said very softly. “Were you&mdash;were you going
to have ice-cream for supper, maybe?”</p>

<p>Betty stifled an impulse to take the appealing
little figure in her arms and promise her
ice-cream and chicken patties and hot chocolate
and all the other dainties she loved best.
She had been a very naughty little girl, and
mother would say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister, oddly enough, was also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>thinking of mother.  “I guess it doesn’t matter
what you’re going to have,” she announced
hastily. “I guess mother would say I’d better
go back and think it all over by myself
quietly, and&mdash;and next time ’member to ask
you first what you think about tattle-tales
that don’t mean to be and&mdash;and perhaps
come some other night for supper. Oh”&mdash;her
voice broke&mdash;“I honestly forgot that I’m
to go home.”</p>

<p>“But we’re friends again, now,” Betty told
her, “and you’re going to tell me things just
as you always have. Aren’t you? Will you,
I mean, if I should think it over, and decide
that it will be all right for you to stay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. I will ask you about every
least little thing I want to do,” declared Dorothy
earnestly. “Do you think that maybe
you’ll decide I may stay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’ll decide that you may
stay,” laughed Betty. “So don’t ever make
me sorry that I’ve decided that way.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. I’m sure I won’t. I just hate
to have you cry, Betty.”</p>

<p>“I think,” Betty told her with a very sober
face, “that you’d better not come for supper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>for two whole weeks. That will make you
remember better perhaps. And when you
come you may bring your new chum, if Miss
Dick is willing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody for joy!” The Smallest Sister
quite overlooked the penalty imposed on herself
in the idea of being able to do something
for her dear, misused Frisky.</p>

<p>She said good-bye contentedly, because she
could tell Frisky the sooner by going home
to tea, and she skip-hopped down-stairs and
up the street much too gaily for a naughty
little girl who had been deprived of a treat
and sent away to think over her naughtiness
in private.</p>

<p>Betty watched her smilingly. “I don’t
seem to be able not to spoil her,” she reflected.
“But she’s just as sweet as she can be usually.
And she came back of herself to tell me, and
she really sent herself home, so I guess it’s
all right&mdash;that is, if this new chum is a nice
girl. I do hope she is.”</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister did not ask to be invited
to supper before the appointed time, though
two meals a week with Betty or Eugenia were
her usual allowance, and she had grumbled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>and even wept before, if anything had happened
to keep her away.</p>

<p>“Poor Francisca can’t even go to walk or
down-town for two weeks. I guess I can give
up one thing I like as long as that,” she told
Eugenia, when that soft-hearted little person
suggested intervening with Betty for a restoration
of privileges. “Francisca says it’s a
comfort to her to feel that somebody else has
troubles.”</p>

<p>On the appointed evening Eugenia had a
house-play rehearsal from five to six, a class
officers’ meeting at quarter to seven, and a
written lesson to cram for in Psych. 6. So
Betty and the chums supped alone at a cunning
little table by the Tally-ho’s famous fireplace.
It was lighted with the “extra-special”
candle-shades and there were new menu-cards
with fat, rosy-faced, red-coated coachmen
cracking long whips at the top, and an adorable
sketch of the Peter Pan Annex growing
up the left side. Bob Enderby had designed
them&mdash;under protest, because he said he was
much too famous to be doing menu-cards
nowadays; Madeline had colored them by
hand, and the Tally-ho waitress had to keep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>a sharp lookout to prevent their all being
carried off for souvenirs. One was lost that
very evening; yes, for the first time in the
Tally-ho’s history, an extra-special candle-shade
was missing at the close of the dinner-hour.</p>

<p>Francisca and Dorothy arrived late and
breathless&mdash;they had been kept to tidy their
rooms, Dorothy explained, but Francisca
shook her head playfully at her small friend
and took all the blame.</p>

<p>“I’m always being kept for something,”
she said cheerfully. “It’s a perfect miracle
that I’m here at all. If I don’t have to copy
my French exercise one hundred times because
I didn’t pay attention in class, I have
to learn ‘Paradise Lost’ because I contradicted
Kit&mdash;Miss Carson, or else I don’t pick up my
nightie and&mdash;well, I’m just always in hot
water, Miss Wales. It was lovely of you to
ask me. Please call me Frisky&mdash;everybody
does.”</p>

<p>Francisca was the prettiest girl&mdash;next to
Eleanor Watson&mdash;that Betty had ever seen.
Her eyes were soft and deep and very, very
brown&mdash;like big chocolate creams. Her hair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>was dark and wavy, growing low down on
her forehead in a widow’s peak. She puffed
it out around her face in a fashion that was
too old for her, but was nevertheless very becoming.
Her manner was that of an older
girl too&mdash;very assured and confident, but
very charming. When she smiled, which she
did most of the time, two big dimples showed.
She lisped a little, and this gave a funny,
childlike twist to her remarks, which were
not at all childlike. She adopted a curious
attitude of resignation toward the cruel fate
that kept her always “in hot water.” She
was sweetly forgiving toward those who had
inflicted the two weeks’ penance just ended,
and she thanked Betty for her opinion, sent
by Dorothy, about little Shirley Ware. She
had entirely forgiven Shirley, she said, and
she meant to forget about it and hoped Shirley
would do the same.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “all the little
girls love me so that I imagine they did make
her pretty uncomfortable. I never meant
them to, Miss Wales, but you can’t help being
a favorite and having people champion your
cause. Can you now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>She made picturesquely vague references to
some secret sorrow that was even worse than
being in perpetual hot water at Miss Dick’s.
Afterward Betty inquired about it from
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s got a stepmother,” Dorothy explained
in awe-struck tones. “They don’t
get along well together. Frisky says she’s
very unsympathetic.” Dorothy pulled out
the long word with much difficulty.</p>

<p>But for all her vanity and absurdity Frisky
Fenton was a lovable creature. She was
preëminently a “jolly girl.” She had comical
names for all Miss Dick’s teachers. She hit
off the peculiarities of her schoolmates, and
told absurd stories about them. She noticed
everything that went on around her and kept
up a vivacious fire of comment. As soon as
she forgot to affect resignation and the secret
sorrow, she was most appreciative of all the
pleasures life had to offer and particularly of
the treat Betty had given her. Everything
they had to eat was “simply great,” the Tally-ho
was “exactly perfect,” Betty was “too
sweet,” and Dorothy “a little darling.”</p>

<p>Betty decided that she was only silly on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>top, and, though she much preferred Shirley
as a best friend for Dorothy, she saw no reason
to worry about Francisca’s bad influence,
especially as the Smallest Sister displayed
much conscientiousness in the matter of coming
to consult her big sister on all important
matters.</p>

<p>She came twice that very week. Once it
was to ask if she should wear her best white
dress, or only her second best blue one to
Shirley’s birthday party. Frisky had advised
the best, under all the delicate circumstances,
but Dorothy wanted to be quite sure. The
next time a moral question was involved. If
you were asked to a spread after bedtime was
it wrong to go? Betty, who detested prigs,
dexterously evaded the issue.</p>

<p>“It’s rather messy eating in the dark, and
you must get awfully sleepy waiting for the
teachers to go to bed. When you’ve all got
desperately hungry for good eats let me know,
and we’ll have a scrumptious spread at the
Tally-ho.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DOLL WAVE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> B. C. A. initiation was naturally a joyous
occasion. To begin with, Babbie Hildreth
was commanded to stand for half an hour outside
the tea-shop with a huge “engaged”
sign pinned across her shoulders. She smiled
composedly, waited patiently for the sign to
be adjusted, and then, since no particular position
had been specified, mounted hastily to
the top story of the Peter Pan Annex, where
the yellowing leaves completely hid her from
curious eyes. Eleanor was meanwhile led to
the kitchen and told to make sugar-cookies
after the family recipe. As she had never
in her life made sugar-cookies&mdash;or any other
kind&mdash;her demonstration proved entertaining
enough to while away the half hour very pleasantly.
Then Babbie was called down, given
one of Eleanor’s cookies, and told to keep on
eating it until she could guess what it was
meant to be. She ate it all, making many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>vain protests, and was only excused from
sampling another because she threatened, in
an irresistibly clever speech, to appeal to the
Humane Society. Mary Brooks was next instructed
to write to the person whom she
thought it most concerned, warning him
about Eleanor’s lack of domestic accomplishments.
Then Madeline read some “Rules for
the Engaged Member,” which were almost as
funny as the “Rules for the Perfect Patron.”</p>

<p>Babbie had just been put in the most retired
corner of the B. C. A.’s stall and told
to do her “Mary-had-a-Little-Lamb” stunt,
when Georgia and the Dutton twins arrived
upon the scene, hot from a tennis match and
voicing a reckless determination to go straight
through all the sundaes and cooling drinks
on the new menu.</p>

<p>“We can sit with you, can’t we?” asked
Straight Dutton. “The other stalls all have
people in them, and Fluffy’s hair is a disgrace
to be seen.”</p>

<p>“Then take her out behind the house&mdash;or
shop or barn, whatever you call it&mdash;and pin
it up,” Madeline told them severely. “Certainly
you can’t come in here. This is a B.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>C. A. tea-drinking and initiation. You’re not
B. C. A.’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s not our fault. It’s perfectly mean
of you to have a secret society and leave us
out,” wailed Fluffy. “Think of all the orders
we got you for skirt braids.”</p>

<p>“In this hard world, my children, virtue
is often its only reward,” Mary reminded
them sweetly. “Run away now and play.”</p>

<p>“Let’s spite them by stalking out of their
old tea-shop and transferring our valuable
patronage to Cuyler’s,” suggested Georgia.</p>

<p>“I’m too tired to stir,” protested Fluffy.
“Let’s stay here and play a lovely party of
our own right under their noses, and never
ask them to come.”</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down quick.”</p>

<p>“Shall we begin with sundaes or lemonade?”</p>

<p>“With both,” announced Fluffy with decision,
smiling so persuasively at Nora that
she abandoned two fussy heads of departments,
who wanted more hot water, milk for
their tea instead of lemon, and steamed muffins
instead of toasted, while she supplied
Fluffy, first with hairpins from the box that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>Betty kept in her desk on purpose for such
emergencies, and then with three sundaes and
two cold drinks.</p>

<p>Fluffy arranged the five glasses in an artistic
crescent in front of her, and sipped and
tasted happily.</p>

<p>“You’re not true sports,” she told the others,
who had been content to begin with one order
each. “You won’t be hungry after the
second thing you order&mdash;or maybe the third
for Georgia-of-the-huge-appetite&mdash;and then
you’ll stop, whereas I&mdash;&mdash;” She waved her
hand around the inviting crescent. “The
fateful check is made out, and I can eat ’em or
leave ’em&mdash;it’s all the same to my pocketbook
and the Tally-ho. I wish Betty Wales would
come out and say if I’m not the Perfect Patron
this trip.”</p>

<p>“Well, she won’t,” declared Straight practically,
“and if she should you’d better remember
that it’s your duty to act very
haughty and independent. Come on now
and think up something nice for us to do.”</p>

<p>“Wish we knew what B. C. A. meant,”
Georgia reflected. “Then we could parody
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we don’t,” Straight reminded her
sharply, “so it’s no use wishing. We’ve worn
ourselves out before this trying to guess.
The thing to do is to think of some regular
picnic of a stunt that they’ll just
wish they’d thought of first. Then they’ll
respect us more, and realize what a mistake
they made in having a snippy little 19&mdash;
society, when they might have had us in it
too.”</p>

<p>“S-h!” ordered Fluffy impatiently. “Nobody
can think of anything while you chatter
along like that. Let’s keep perfectly
still for five minutes&mdash;just eat and think.
I’m sure we shall get at it that way. Georgia,
you’ve got a watch that goes. Tell us
when time’s up.”</p>

<p>Georgia was too much occupied with keeping
track of the time limit to hit upon an
idea, and when Straight’s sundae gave out at
the end of the second minute, she could not
keep her eyes and her mind from a furtive
consideration of the menu. So nobody interrupted
Fluffy when, at Georgia’s “Time’s
up,” she shot out a triumphant, “I’ve got
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not sure whether it’s four minutes or
five,” said Georgia anxiously, “but if you’ve
got it, Fluffy, fire away.”</p>

<p>“Well, only the general plan,” explained
Fluffy modestly. “I think we ought to set
a silly fashion. We can&mdash;girls are like sheep,
and we’ve made a reputation for doing interesting
things that all the others wish they
could do too. We can call the thing the
‘C. I.’s’&mdash;that’s for Complete Idiots&mdash;and not
tell a soul what it means until we’re ready to
back out and let our devoted followers feel as
silly as they have to. It will be a circus pretending
to be keen for it ourselves and egging
the others on, and it will just show the
B. C. A.’s that we’re not as young and simple-minded
as maybe they think us.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me,” agreed Georgia,
“only what fashion shall we set?”</p>

<p>Fluffy frowned and rumpled her hair
absently. “I can’t think of anything silly
enough. Big bows and pompadours and
coronet braids and so on are as silly now
as they possibly could be. Shoes without
heels wouldn’t be extreme enough. Prexy
wouldn’t let us wear a uniform, even if we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>could think of a ridiculous enough one. I
guess it can’t be anything about dress.”</p>

<p>“Some fad for our desks, like ploshkins,”
suggested Straight.</p>

<p>“Only not a bit copy-catted from that, because
some of the B. C. A.’s helped start
ploshkins,” amended Georgia.</p>

<p>“Let’s take another think,” said Fluffy.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” begged Straight, and providently
ordered two more sundaes to span
the terrible interval.</p>

<p>“You keep time on this thought,” ordered
Georgia, passing her watch to Fluffy.</p>

<p>Fluffy nodded abstractedly.</p>

<p>“Five minutes,” she announced presently.
“I can’t think of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This time I’ve got it,” Georgia broke in
eagerly. “First I thought of a silly game
like tops or marbles or skipping ropes, and
then I thought of dolls&mdash;buying them and
dressing them and carrying them around. I
heard of a girls’ school that did it once in
dead earnest.” She looked anxiously at
Fluffy, who could “get people excited over
the fourth dimension if she wanted to.”
“What about it, Fluff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Fluffy sipped from each of her five glasses
reflectively before she answered.</p>

<p>“Dolls it is,” she said briefly at last.
“Come on down and buy ours now.”</p>

<p>The straight-haired twin had never played
with dolls in her life, having scorned all feminine
diversions and spent her youth chasing
rabbits, riding her pony, or playing tag,
hockey, and prisoner’s base with her brothers
and her brothers’ friends. She chose the biggest,
most elegant, and expensive French doll
in the shop, named her Rosa Marie on the
spot, and paid for Georgia’s choice&mdash;a huge
wooden doll with staring blue eyes and matted
black hair&mdash;on condition that Georgia
would help her dress Rosa Marie.</p>

<p>“You’re actually getting fond of Rosa Marie
already,” Georgia teased her.</p>

<p>“Maybe I am,” said Straight stoutly, “but
you’d better not fuss, when I’m spending such
a lot to help along your game.”</p>

<p>“Lucky we’re starting on it so early in the
month,” Fluffy said, a baby doll in a lace
bonnet and a long white dress in one hand,
and an Esquimaux, in white fur from head to
foot, in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Get ’em both and come along,” advised
Georgia. “You’ll look terribly cute going
home with one on each arm.”</p>

<p>“And if you get small ones you can be
getting more all the time,” Straight took her
up. “Have a regular family, you know, and
a carriage to take them out in, and a doll’s
house to keep them in at home. A doll’s house
would look great in your room, Fluffy dear.”</p>

<p>“It’s so bare and cheerless that it just
needs a doll’s house,” declared Georgia. “I
dare you to buy one and put it on your royal
Bokara rug, between your teakwood table and
your Dutch tee-stopf, with your best Whistler
print hanging over it.”</p>

<p>Fluffy turned to the saleswoman. “These
two, please,” she said, “and let me see your
largest, loveliest doll’s house.”</p>

<p>The organizers and charter members of the
C. I.’s tramped home in the autumn twilight,
quarreling amiably about the relative
advantages of “risking” to-morrow’s Logic
quiz and writing “Lit.” papers between
breakfast and chapel, or making a night of
it&mdash;and in that case should the doll-dressing
come before or after ten?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t ‘risk’ Logic,” Straight confessed
sadly. “I’ve been warned already. Don’t
make me sit up all by myself to cram. I’d
almost rather not dress Rosa Marie to-night
than do that.”</p>

<p>Just then they ran into Eugenia Ford coming
out of the Music Building.</p>

<p>“Hello, Miss Ford,” Georgia greeted her
pleasantly. “Look at Fluffy’s dolls. Have
you got one yet?”</p>

<p>Eugenia, somewhat dazed by the suddenness
of the onslaught, went into raptures over
the baby doll, blushingly acknowledged that
she hadn’t one, and begged for more light on
the matter.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re not so far behind the
times,” Fluffy consoled her sweetly. “The
limit is day after to-morrow, isn’t it, Georgia?
If you get one all ready by then, you can join
the C. I.’s.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is that?” demanded
Eugenia eagerly.</p>

<p>“I believe the meaning’s to be a secret for
a while,” Straight explained solemnly, “but
if you have a doll you can belong; that I’m
sure of. We’ve got ours here.” She patted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>Rosa Marie, and pointed to Georgia’s ungainly
parcel. “It’s sure to be fun. Anyway,
we’re all for it.”</p>

<p>“It sounds just splendid,” declared Eugenia,
who still had aspirations toward intimacy
with the jolliest, most exclusive crowd
in Harding. “It’s lovely of you to tell me
about it. Can anybody&mdash;can I tell my
friends?”</p>

<p>The conspirators exchanged glances. Democracy
would repel Eugenia. To her the
C. I.’s must be made to appear highly exclusive.</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” Fluffy said at last. “It’s for anybody&mdash;that
is anybody you’d ask. The dolls
have got to be dressed by day after to-morrow,
you know. Straight’s is going to be a perfect
wonder. We’re thinking of having a doll-show
later, so you’d better take some pains
with yours. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the stores are closed yet,”
added Straight loudly as Eugenia started off.
“I ought to have bought some real lace for
Rosa Marie’s petticoat.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back, even if we are late to dinner,”
declaimed Georgia distinctly. “By to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
everybody in the place will be rushing
down for dolls and dolls’ dresses, and
they’ll be dreadfully picked over.”</p>

<p>The conspirators paused to watch the effect
of their sallies, and subsided, overcome with
mirth, on the Music Building steps, when little
Eugenia walked more slowly, halted, and
finally turned down the hill toward Main Street.</p>

<p>“She’s not going to be at the tail of any
procession of Complete Idiots,” chuckled
Georgia. “Oh, I say, here comes Christabel
Porter! Let’s tackle her.”</p>

<p>Christabel Porter was a lanky, spectacled
senior with a marvelous memory, a passion
for scientific research, a deep hatred of persons
who misnamed helpless infants, and a
whole-hearted contempt for the frivolity of
the Dutton twins and their tribe. She respected
Georgia, making an exception of her
because she always wore her hair plain and
never indulged in any kind of feminine furbelows.</p>

<p>“No use,” objected Fluffy. “Let’s go
along to dinner so we can get through and
begin on Rosa Marie’s clothes.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got all night,” said Georgia easily,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>“if we need it. Let’s have a try at the impossible.
Hello, Christabel. Have you been
buying one too?”</p>

<p>Christabel squinted near-sightedly at the
trio. “Oh, it’s you,” she said. “What on
earth are you doing up here on those cold
steps, when it’s past six already?”</p>

<p>“Talking to you,” Fluffy told her sweetly,
holding the Esquimaux up against the western
light and smoothing the baby’s skirts ostentatiously.</p>

<p>Christabel squinted harder. “Dolls!” she
scoffed at last. “What on earth are you up
to now?”</p>

<p>“Georgia’s is the biggest,” said Straight
sulkily. “Tell her about the C. I.’s, Georgia.
You were the one that thought of it. It’s
nothing to blame us about.”</p>

<p>Christabel listened to the tale in bewildered
silence. At the conclusion she gave a
deep sigh. “Count me in,” she said. “I’m
thinking of taking a Ph. D. in psychology
at Zurich next winter. I guess this is as good
an experiment on the play instinct as I’m
likely to run up against.” She sighed again
deeply. “Of all the queer unaccountable reactions!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span> If it was after midyears, perhaps I
could understand it, but now&mdash;&mdash; Don’t tell
any one else that I’m studying it, please; they
wouldn’t be quite natural if they knew.
Where do you buy dolls?”</p>

<p>That evening the Belden House was in a
flutter of excitement. The Dutton twins were
in Georgia’s room with the door locked.
Fluffy’s dolls were reposing on her bed, carefully
pillowed on two lace-edged sachets.
The doll’s house was delivered about eight
o’clock, and most of the paper was torn off it
in some way or other before Fluffy saw it.
Georgia sternly refused to open the door to
any one. The sound of cheerful conversation,
laughter, and little squeals of pleasurable excitement
floated out over the transom.
Plainly the Dutton twins and Georgia Ames
were not studying Logic&mdash;or they were studying
it after peculiar methods of their own.
Furthermore, Fluffy’s note-book was lying
conspicuously on her table, and Barbara West
had borrowed Georgia’s, and was almost in
tears over its owner’s curt refusal to come out
and explain what Barbara angrily described
as “two pages of hen scratches about undistributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
middle, and that was just what I
didn’t get!”</p>

<p>When the quarter to ten warning-bell jangled
through the Belden House halls, Georgia
threw her room hospitably open. With
magic celerity it filled up with curious girls,
who stared in amazement at the spectacle of
Straight Dutton rocking a huge doll to sleep,
laughed at Wooden’s mussy wig and checked
gingham apron&mdash;“Exactly like the ones I
used to have to wear,” Georgia explained pathetically,
“and the other girls laughed at me
just that way”&mdash;and noisily demanded explanations
of the absurd trio’s latest eccentricity.
Next morning alarm clocks went off extra
early, Main Street swarmed with Belden House
girls on a before-chapel quest for dolls, the
toy-shop proprietor telegraphed a hurry order
to the nearest doll factory, and surreptitious
examination of queer, hunchy bundles broke
the tension of the Logic quiz and blocked the
hallways between classes.</p>

<p>That afternoon there were doll-dressing bees
at every campus house, and Fluffy’s doll-tea
in Jack o’ Hearts’ stall was the centre of interest
at the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>A pleasant vagueness about the C. I.’s continued
to pervade the speech of its founders.
Nobody seemed to know exactly where or
when the first meeting would be held. But,
quite irrespective of the club or the mystic
time-limit imposed for membership, the doll
fad took possession of Harding. It was a red
letter day for the conspirators when the junior
class president, an influential young person
who prided herself on her independence of
character, appeared on the platform at class
meeting, with her doll in her arms. The college
poetess, who went walking alone and had
had several of her verses printed in a real
magazine&mdash;sure signs of genius&mdash;took her
darling doll to call on the head of the English
Department, with whom she was very intimate.
A maid who went to the door with
hot water for the tea declared “cross her
heart” that she saw Miss Raymond with the
doll on her lap, undressing it, “just like any
kid.” However that might have been, the
poetess continued to be great friends with
Miss Raymond; evidently the doll episode
had not “queered” her with that august
lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>So the doll wave swept the college. Spreads
became doll parties, French lingerie was recklessly
cut up into doll dresses, girls who had
never sewed a stitch in their lives labored
over elaborate doll costumes, and on warm
October afternoons the campus resembled a
mammoth doll market, with Paradise as an
annex for exclusive little parties. Tennis
matches and basket-ball games were watched
by doll-laden spectators, and some of the best
athletes actually refused to go into their
autumnal class meets because it took too
much time when the doll parties were so
much more fun.</p>

<p>Christabel Porter showed Georgia, in strict
confidence, the tabulated results of her observations.</p>

<p>“Insane, one,” it read; “still infantile, all
freshmen, nearly all sophomores, many juniors
and seniors; slavish copy-cats, practically all
the rest of the college; can’t be accounted for,
three.”</p>

<p>“The one,” she explained, “is the college
poetess, and the three are you and the Duttons.
You’re not infants, you’re not stupid,
you’re not exactly crazy, you’re far from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>being copy-cats. I don’t understand you at
all.”</p>

<p>“You never will, Christabel,” Georgia told
her sweetly, “no matter if you take a dozen
Ph. D.’s in Psych. at Zurich. But you
shall presently understand the C. I.’s. There
is a meeting in my room to-morrow at
two.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it be rather crowded?” inquired
Christabel anxiously, glancing around Georgia’s
particularly minute and very much littered
“single.”</p>

<p>Georgia smiled enigmatically. “Oh, it
won’t take long, I think. It means so much
red tape to arrange for a more official place,
like the gym or the Student’s Building hall.
The back campus would do, only the weather
man says rain for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Next morning Georgia and the Duttons cut
Logic (except Straight, who dared not), Lit.,
and Zoölogy lab.</p>

<p>By noon Georgia’s walls were ablaze with
effective decorations. “Complete Idiots,”
printed in every color of the rainbow, was
interspersed with sketches of every conceivable
type of girl playing with every possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>variety of doll. Straight could draw, if she
could not adorn a Logic class. Fluffy and
Georgia sighed to think that other people’s
“memorabils” would be enriched with these
fascinating trophies.</p>

<p>At a few minutes before one Straight and
Fluffy slipped unostentatiously down-town in
the rain to have lunch at a small new place
where there would be no gamut of inquiry to
run about the afternoon’s plans. Georgia
meanwhile locked her door and waited until
the house was at lunch, when she let herself
out, posted a sign, reading, “Please don’t
disturb until two o’clock,” hurried down-town
by a back way, and joined the Duttons just
in time to gobble a sandwich or two before
the next train to the Junction.</p>

<p>On the station platform they met Madeline
and Babbie Hildreth.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Madeline.</p>

<p>“To the big city to buy Georgia a turban
swirl,” Fluffy told them with a smile.</p>

<p>“I thought your C. I. blow-out was to-day,”
said Madeline innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!” cried Georgia. “So you do take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>some interest in our society, though you
haven’t appeared to. You’ll take more by
to-morrow. Why don’t you go to the meeting?
You’ve just got time. I know they’d
vote to set aside the entrance requirements in
favor of such distinguished persons as yourselves.”</p>

<p>“But why&mdash;&mdash;” began Babbie.</p>

<p>“Georgia can’t live another minute without
a turban swirl,” jeered Straight, climbing on
to the train before it had fairly stopped.</p>

<p>“Tell all inquiring friends that we deeply
regret not being able to be present at the fatal
moment,” added Georgia.</p>

<p>“Be a dear, Madeline, and go, so you can
tell us how they took it,” begged Fluffy.</p>

<p>“There are perfectly lovely souvenirs,”
chanted the trio in chorus, as their train
pulled out.</p>

<p>The organizers of the C. I.’s witnessed part
of the matinée. Georgia and Straight bought
a blue chiffon waist in partnership, and
Fluffy, from force of habit, bought a Chinese
doll. They had an early dinner to conform
as far as possible to the rules about being
chaperoned in town after dark, and they arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
in Harding again, tired and damp but
expectant, soon after seven.</p>

<p>At the Tally-ho they stopped to find out,
if possible, what sort of reception they were
likely to get further on. Madeline welcomed
them joyously.</p>

<p>“I went,” she said, “and I knew you’d
want me to take charge in your absence, so I
did. Everybody who got a souvenir”&mdash;she
pointed to hers, decorating the wall back of
the famous desk&mdash;“is happy. Others are
amused or wrathful according to the stage of
development of their sense of humor. Christabel
Porter sent word that she understands
you less than ever. The poetess almost wept
at such desecration of her idyllic amusement.
About two hundred girls came, and the rest
of the college either tried to and couldn’t get
inside the Belden House door, or wept at home
because of their ineligibility. Mary Brooks
wept too, because her famous rumor stunt
isn’t in it any longer with this gallery play of
yours. She wants you three to come to dinner
to-morrow&mdash;Professor Hinsdale is away&mdash;and
tell her all about it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the trio nonchalantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’re pretty nearly smart
enough to belong to the B. C. A.’s?” demanded
Georgia tartly at last.</p>

<p>“The B. C. A.’s?” repeated Madeline.
“Oh, was that what you were venting your
beautiful sarcasm on? We thought you were
hitting all those new department societies
that everybody is making such a silly fuss
about getting into.”</p>

<p>The trio exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“It was partly that,” admitted Georgia.
“We’ve absolutely sworn off from being in
such things ourselves, or sending violets,
except to girls who make Dramatic Club or
Clio&mdash;the real big honors, you know.”</p>

<p>“And have you also sworn off from going
to the celebration dinners?” inquired Madeline
with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>“We haven’t decided about that,” Georgia
informed her with dignity. “But please
don’t forget,” she added solemnly, “that your
crowd began this foolish club idea, and has
done a lot to develop it. It was you principally
that we meant to hit off.”</p>

<p>Madeline grinned. “I really wish you were
eligible to the B. C. A.’s,” she said, “because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>then we could see how manfully you would
resist temptation. But it will be at least a
year before you can any of you possibly meet&mdash;well,
we’ll call it the age limit. So don’t
waste time hunting over the bulletin-boards
for a notice of your election.”</p>

<p>“We are generally considered rather frivolous,”
Georgia told her severely, “but we do
stick to our principles&mdash;of which the anti-club
idea is one that we cherish greatly.”</p>

<p>“Though you’ve very recently acquired it,”
murmured Madeline.</p>

<p>“Very,” agreed Georgia cheerfully. “Good-night.”</p>

<p>Outside the bewildered Dutton twins sorrowfully
took Georgia to task for spoiling forever
their chances with the B. C. A.’s.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” demanded Straight.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember why we started the
whole doll business?” asked Fluffy.</p>

<p>Georgia, who had been rather absent and
constrained during the afternoon’s adventures,
gazed at them pityingly. “You little innocents!”
she said at last. “Can’t you see
what she’s done for us? Imagine the mud
that two hundred girls have tracked through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>the Belden House halls. Imagine the rage of
the matron, and the things that some of the
faculty prigs will say about this whole business.
I’ve been worried to death all day, to
tell you the truth. But now we don’t have to
care. We’re reformers. We’re disciples of
the simple life, giving demonstrations of the
foolishness of over-organization. We’re sorry
about the mud and all that, of course. We’re&mdash;anyhow,
I demand the satisfaction of telling
Christabel Porter the truth about us. I can’t
bear to have her explain us wrong, after all
her trouble.” Georgia splashed into a puddle
and exclaimed angrily at the incident.
“What in Christendom can B. C. A. stand
for?” she muttered wrathfully, stamping off
the mud.</p>

<p>“Who cares?” cried Straight, splashing
into a puddle herself for sheer bravado.</p>

<p>“Who indeed?” Fluffy took her up.
“I’ve had a thought, Georgia. Let’s keep on
playing dolls. Then Christabel Porter can’t
explain us at all. She’ll be too mixed up to
ever go to Zurich.”</p>

<span class="smaller">MORE ARCHITECT’S PLANS, AND A MYSTERY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> lovely afternoon in late October, Jim
Watson, arrayed in very correct riding clothes,
poked his head gingerly into Betty’s office,
and having thus made quite sure that she was
alone, stepped briskly inside and stood smiling
quizzically down at her over the top of
her big desk.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke to-day?” Betty inquired,
smiling frankly back at him.</p>

<p>“Same old joke,” said Jim, leaning his elbow
comfortably on a pile of pamphlets.
“Small person with a generally frivolous appearance,
sitting at the biggest roller-top desk
on the market, flanked on the right by a filing
cabinet and on the left by a typewriter. Vast
correspondence strewn over desk. Brow of
small person puckered in deep thought.
Dimple of small&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s quite enough,” interrupted Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>severely. “I am not a joke, except to really
frivolous persons like you, and I refuse to
have my time wasted listening to such nonsense.
Where’s Eleanor?”</p>

<p>Jim sighed deeply. “Where is Eleanor,
indeed? Paying calls, known as ‘friendly
visits,’ on the families of her Terrible Ten&mdash;her
young Italians. I thought she came up
here to comfort and amuse my leisure hours,
but that’s certainly not what she’s staying on
for. Is this your day for office hours?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” Betty admitted doubtfully, “but I
thought I’d stay and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please think again,” Jim coaxed in his
most beguiling fashion. “It’s a gorgeous
afternoon. Please come for a ride.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve engaged Hartman’s best horses&mdash;the
big bay for me and the little black Queen,
that you Harding girls are so crazy about, for
you.”</p>

<p>“I thought Virginia Day had Queen every
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Not when I want her. I’m a privileged
person at Hartman’s, because I rode every
day last summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Well, but you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you come I’ll tell you a grand secret.”</p>

<p>“About Morton Hall?” demanded Betty
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No fair guessing. Will you come?”</p>

<p>Betty looked at him hard, and then out the
window at the campus, sparkling in the autumn
sunshine. “Oh, Jim, yes! I can’t resist
such a very nice party. How soon can
we start?”</p>

<p>“How soon can you be ready?”</p>

<p>In a flash Betty had snapped down the lid
of the absurdly big desk, closed the filing cabinet,
adjusted the typewriter top, and picked
up a book and her keys. “In ten minutes,”
she said, bundling Jim out ahead of her and
locking the door. “If you should have to
wait, you can be finding me a switch for a
riding-crop. Mine’s broken. See you in ten
minutes.” And she was off down the hill to
change her dress.</p>

<p>Jim watched her lithe little figure out of
sight, and then strode off to get the horses,
whistling loudly. It was a triumph, even
with the assistance of Queen and the promise
of a secret, to have lured Betty Wales from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>her official duties for a whole long, sunshiny
afternoon.</p>

<p>They galloped out of town at a pace to
scandalize the sedate dwellers on Elm Street.
Where the road passed the Golf Club, under
the flickering shade of tall oaks, Betty drew
up to a walk and leaned forward to pat
Queen’s glossy neck.</p>

<p>“That was perfectly splendid, Jim,” she declared.
“Doesn’t it make you wish you were
a bird?”</p>

<p>“Makes me think I’m a bird when I go
cross-country out in Colorado, over a meadow
of soft, springy turf, and then splash through
a brook, and out into the first real shade
I’ve seen for a week, maybe. Makes me
wish I was a cow-puncher when I think of
it now.”</p>

<p>“Then you couldn’t be the distinguished
architect of Morton Hall,” Betty reminded
him gaily. “Tell me the grand secret,
Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim looked disappointed. He had hoped
she would forget about the secret. “Oh, it’s
not so much,” he said. “Only if your august
Highness wishes to eat her Thanksgiving dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
in Morton Hall, Morton Hall will be
ready for her.”</p>

<p>“Jim! How splendid! Are you perfectly
sure?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded grimly. “I’ve slaved and I’ve
made the men slave, and we didn’t do it for
the peppery Mr. Morton, either. We did it
for you, because you seemed to think a few
days would make such a big difference. Well,
they do&mdash;in a way, of course.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Betty innocently.</p>

<p>“I mean,” declared Jim earnestly, “that
I’m a self-sacrificing person, if ever there was
one. I’ve deliberately cut myself out of
days and weeks of good times here in Harding&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim!” Betty flashed him a merry
smile. “Please don’t be silly. You know
you’re fond of your work and anxious to go
where it takes you, and just puffed up with
pride to think that you’ve beaten the time
limit your firm had set. Why, Jim, Thanksgiving
is only four weeks off!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” gloomily.</p>

<p>“And the list of Morton Hall girls isn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>half made out. The matron will manage the
moving-in, I suppose&mdash;arranging furniture
and engaging maids, and all. When can the
moving-in begin, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Saturday before Thanksgiving,” still
gloomily.</p>

<p>“We must have a grand housewarming,”
Betty declared. “The B.C.A.’s have decided
on that already, but of course Madeline
couldn’t have an inspiration till she knew the
date, so she could think of something appropriate.
A Thanksgiving housewarming will
certainly be appropriate for that house.
You’ll stay for it, won’t you, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” darkly.</p>

<p>Betty considered, frowning absently. “If
it’s a costume party,&mdash;and most of Madeline’s
nicest ideas are&mdash;why, of course, you probably
can’t come. That will be a perfect shame,
after the way you’ve worked. We’ll have to
have another special housewarming for you
and Mr. Morton.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully.”</p>

<p>Jim’s horse seemed to be giving him a great
deal of trouble. It had edged to the extreme
other side of the road and was curveting and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>plunging nervously. Betty turned Queen to
the other side after him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Ginger?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” Jim assured her coldly.
“He’s just wondering whether this is a real
ride or only a political procession.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed and started Queen into a
canter. “Why didn’t you say you were tired
of walking, silly?” she demanded. Then
suddenly she had an idea. “Of course you
know I shall miss you, Jim,” she said.
“We’re too good friends to bother with saying
things like that, when we both know them.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say about that,” said Jim with
a sudden return of his smile. “But candidly
now, Betty, aren’t you too busy to miss people
much?”</p>

<p>“When I’m too busy to have friends,”
Betty told him earnestly, “I shall just stop
being busy. Life wouldn’t be worth living
without friends.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got such a lot, haven’t you?”
Jim asked, idly flicking at the scarlet sumach
leaves with his crop. They were walking
again now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Any college girl has a lot, and any college
man. Haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “I was just thinking that
one, more or less&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Jim!” Betty’s tone was highly indignant.
“You’re fishing! But you act so blue
to-day, and you’ve worked so hard for Morton
Hall, that I’ll just ask you a question.
Which one of your good friends, ‘more or
less,’ doesn’t matter?”</p>

<p>Jim laughed. “You’re right, of course. I
do get blue&mdash;it runs in the family, I guess.
Eleanor’s that way, too.”</p>

<p>“She’s not half as silly as you are,” laughed
Betty. “But seriously, Jim, I don’t know
what I shall do when you go. You’re such a
splendid safety-valve. And then these glorious
rides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ve had only two&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There you go again,” sighed Betty. “Do
you expect a busy person like me to
take whole afternoons off every single week?
Oh, dear! Aren’t those bittersweet berries
on the vines growing over those little
trees?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about the habits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>or appearance of bittersweet berries, but I’ll
bring you some.”</p>

<p>He was back in a few minutes with a bunch
of the pretty red berries. Betty looked at
them closely. “Oh, it is bittersweet!” she
cried. “Madeline and Emily want some most
dreadfully for the copper jar at the Tally-ho.
Could we carry a few sprays back, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“Carry a bushel, if you like,” Jim declared.
“But first&mdash;there’s a trail up there that starts
off through the woods. What do you say to
trying it?”</p>

<p>They rode as far as they could under the
red and yellow boughs, and when the trail
stopped Jim discovered a grove of walnut
trees, and Betty declared that proved they
were almost up Walnut Mountain. So they
tied the horses and climbed the rest of the
way, up a steep, pebbly path, hearing a partridge
whirr on the way and scattering a
whole family of lively little chipmunks who
ran ahead of them, scolding angrily at so unwarrantable
an intrusion of their private
playground. They arrived panting at the
top at last, and stayed so long looking at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>view that they felt obliged to run all the way
down to the horses. Then Jim showed Betty
how to pack a “bushel” of bittersweet behind
her saddle for the Tally-ho, and tied
another bunch on his for Morton Hall. They
cantered all the way home in the crisp, frosty
dusk, and Jim, in answer to Betty’s mocking
inquiry about his blues, declared it had been
such a ripping afternoon that he believed
they were lost forever in the Bay of the
Ploshkin.</p>

<p>Betty dined at the Tally-ho, with Madeline,
Straight Dutton, and Georgia.</p>

<p>“We’ve found a perfect Morton Hall-ite for
you,” Georgia informed her eagerly. “Just
exactly the kind you want, and she hadn’t
applied and wasn’t going to.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” demanded Betty. “And
will she come?”</p>

<p>“Binks Ames didn’t ask her because she
was afraid she’d muddle it,” Georgia explained
lucidly, putting the cart before the
horse. “Binks discovered her, and told us to
tell you. She’s in the infirmary&mdash;Binks, I
mean, and the other girl, too. Got the
mumps, Binks has, and the other one had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>rheumatism or something. Binks is my
freshman cousin&mdash;the peculiar one from
Boston. Her real name is Elizabeth B.
Browning Ames&mdash;after the poetess. Her
mother goes in for Browning classes and
things, but Binks is the soul of prose.”</p>

<p>“Tell her about the Morton Hall-ite,” advised
Straight. “Binks hasn’t anything to
do much with it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Georgia placidly, “but
she’s rather an interesting person, and Betty
ought to meet her. She’s the kind that’s always
discovering things&mdash;just the way she
discovered this girl.”</p>

<p>“Georgia,” declared Madeline amiably, “I
always knew you had a weakness, of course&mdash;all
mortal creatures have. Now I’ve discovered
that it’s a weakness for family history.
In order to start you on the right track
let me ask you a leading question. What are
the Morton Hall-ite’s name, class, and qualifications
for admission?”</p>

<p>“Name unknown, class unknown, qualifications
extreme general forlornness, and a
boarding place at the end of nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked Betty smilingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Binks didn’t dare ask,” explained
Georgia. “You see Binks knows she’s an
awful blunderer at being nice to people.”</p>

<p>“Then how&mdash;&mdash;” began Betty.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all arranged,” explained
Georgia easily. “You can come with me to-morrow
when I go to see Binks, and if we explain
a little to the matron she’ll let you in to
see the other one. Everybody is sorry for
her, because she seems so blue and forlorn,
and never gets calls or flowers or
letters.”</p>

<p>“She sounds rather formidable, some way,”
Betty demurred. “I think it would be better
for one of the faculty members of the board to
go and see her and ask her.”</p>

<p>“But I promised Binks I’d bring you.
You can at least cheer up the other one, and
if you funk on asking her then you can send
a faculty later.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me that there isn’t going to
be any too much ‘later.’” Betty told them
the great news, ending with, “So please plan
a scrumptious housewarming right away,
Madeline.”</p>

<p>And Madeline promised, grumbling, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
about the constant interruptions to
which her aspiring genius was subject.</p>

<p>“You want a housewarming,” she wailed.
“Eleanor wants a masque for the Terrible
Ten. Mary wants an alumnæ stunt for
Dramatic Club’s June meeting. Dick Blake
wants a pantomime for the Vagabonds’
ladies’ night. So it goes! And the worst of
it is that the editors sternly refuse to want
anything of me&mdash;except the Sunday Supplement
people, and they want nothing but
Vapor for the Vacant-Minded. I’m losing
my mind&mdash;what little I have&mdash;trying to
make the articles sound silly enough.”</p>

<p>Betty went next day with Georgia to see
Binks Ames, who proved to be a thin, brown
little freshman, with wonderful gray eyes and
a friendly, impulsive manner.</p>

<p>“It’s queer about me,” she told them. “I
seem to attract freaks. All my friends at
school were queer unfortunates that my
brothers fussed at having to take around
when they came to visit me. And now the
first thing I’ve done at Harding is to have
mumps at the same time with Miss Ellison,
who writes poems&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Technically known as the C. P., or College
Poet,” Georgia interrupted.</p>

<p>“And a queer scientific person with a bulging
forehead and a squint, named Jones. We
weren’t any of us very sick, and we sat and
talked by the hour, and hit it off beautifully.
And now they’ve gone”&mdash;she lowered her
voice&mdash;“there’s the Mystery. We named her
that because she spooked around and never
came near us, except by mistake. But the
last two days, since we’ve been here alone,
we’ve become quite dangerously chummy, and
she’s told me things to make your heart
ache.”</p>

<p>The sympathetic thrill in Binks’ voice explained
sufficiently why unfortunates always
sought her out, and her next remark gave
further testimony to her real genius for friendship.
“I never let them see that I understand.
It would scare them off. I act as if
they were like everybody else. Seeing that
people know you’re a freak or an unfortunate
only makes you more of a one, don’t you
think? But Georgia has told me that you
are the kind that can straighten things out&mdash;not
just let the poor things stick to you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>like burrs and try to make up to them, the
silly way I do. Now, Georgia, you’d better
wait here. I’ll take Miss Wales in to her
myself, and then you’ll be an excuse for me
to get away and leave her there.”</p>

<p>The Mystery was crouching by a west window,
looking out at Paradise, with the low
sun tangled in the yellow elms on the hill
beyond. She was tall and slight and stooped,
with a muddy complexion and a dull, expressionless
face. She flushed uncomfortably
when she saw them, and received Binks’
stammered explanation about wanting to
share her callers with stolid indifference.
Left alone with her, Betty remembered Anne
Carter, the girl with the scar, and wished
she had made Binks tell her what in this
girl’s life had left her so frightened and hopeless
and so bitterly reticent. She was a junior.
She lived on Porter Hill&mdash;about a mile from
the campus. She didn’t mind the walk; you
could count it in your exercise hours. She
was not particularly interested in any study;
she just took what seemed best. If you meant
to teach it wasn’t wise to specialize too much;
you might have to take a position for Latin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>or Algebra when you had applied for History.
She would prefer to teach English herself.
Betty had brought Binks a new “Argus” to
read. She asked the Mystery&mdash;her name was
Esther Bond&mdash;if she had seen Helena Mason’s
new story.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully clever,” she said. “All her
stories sound so knowing, some way, as if she
had seen and done lots of unusual story-book
sort of things. They have what Miss Raymond
calls atmosphere and the note of reality.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Bond.</p>

<p>“She’s in your class, isn’t she?” Betty rattled
on. “Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know her.”</p>

<p>“Is she really as unusual and fascinating
as her stories seem?” Betty pursued.</p>

<p>“I consider her one of the most commonplace
girls in Harding,” said Miss Bond
stolidly.</p>

<p>“Well, at least you’ve at last said something
besides yes and no,” Betty reflected,
and turned the talk to Binks, the infirmary
régime, and finally to campus life.</p>

<p>When at last, having decided that nothing
was to be gained by delay, she made her suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
about Miss Bond’s coming into Morton
Hall, the Mystery laughed a queer, rasping
laugh.</p>

<p>“I knew that’s what you were getting at,”
she said. “You’re the new secretary. I’m
not so out of things that I don’t know that.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll come?” Betty asked cordially.</p>

<p>“I think not. I’d rather be out of the
campus fun altogether than in it on charity.”</p>

<p>Betty explained as tactfully as possible the
difference between what she called Mr. Morton’s
kindness and what was sometimes meant
by charity, and suggested a few of the advantages
to be gained from living on the campus
for a while.</p>

<p>The Mystery listened apathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter much what I do.
Perhaps I may as well come. Only is there
a room that I can have off by itself somewhere?
I couldn’t stand being tumbled in
with a stranger, or having my door open right
against hers.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Betty eagerly, “you shall
have the tower room. It’s so much by itself
that I told Mr. Watson&mdash;he’s the architect in
charge&mdash;that I was afraid no girl would dare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>to sleep alone there. It’s like an island surrounded
by linen closets, and then being in a
tower it juts out quite away from everything
else. And it’s the very prettiest room in the
house,” she added enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Miss Bond didn’t know that she cared much
how it looked.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know in a day or two how I
decide,” she said. “I should have to see&mdash;there
are some things to consider. Do you
know if the junior novel course has a written
lesson to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Betty didn’t know, and neither did Georgia,
whom she applied to for the information; but
she promised to find out and let the Mystery
know by telephone. Miss Bond thanked her
with the first touch of real feeling she had
shown that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span>, her sleeves rolled up to her
elbows and her trim little figure enveloped in
one of her famous kitchen aprons, stood on
a chair in the china closet of Morton Hall,
covering the top shelves neatly with sheets of
white paper. One of the three richest men in
New York, very damp and red in the face
from his exertions, was screwing in hooks for
pots and pans in the pantry next door. A
rising young architect was helping the pretty
wife of a distinguished psychology professor
wash dishes, ready to put on Betty’s carefully
spread papers. A would-be literary light was
hanging pictures on the softly-tinted walls of
the house parlor. Up-stairs Georgia, Babbie,
and Eugenia Ford were superintending the
efforts of the night-watchman and a janitor to
arrange a bed, a bureau, a wash-stand, a desk,
and two chairs to the best advantage in rooms
guaranteed by the rising young architect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>aforesaid to be perfectly capable of holding
those articles,&mdash;or, in the case of double rooms,
twice the number.</p>

<p>Betty Wales wasn’t very tall, and the
shelves were high and very, very long. Her
arms ached from stretching; her back was
tired from spreading innumerable rugs; her
brain reeled with dozens of petty but important
details. But she worked on doggedly,
pushing back her curls wearily when they got
in her eyes, ordering, coaxing, or bullying her
distinguished assistants, her mind intent on
one thing: Morton Hall must be ready for
the girls when they came to-morrow.</p>

<p>It was all because the matron had sprained
her wrist&mdash;this hurry and scurry and confusion
at the last minute. She had hoped every
day to be able to come on and take charge of
the settling, and from day to day they had
waited, until finally Prexy, realizing that
they had waited much too long, had asked
Betty to take charge in her place. The matron
was coming that afternoon at five, with
her arm still in a sling. Betty had promised
to meet her. Jim Watson was keeping track
of the time, and Mr. Morton’s car would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>ready to take her to the station. At distractingly
frequent intervals the door-bell rang,
and Mary Brooks Hinsdale had to stop wiping
dishes to answer it. In the end Betty always
had to go, but Mary saved her time and
anxiety about appearances by finding out who
each visitor was.</p>

<p>“Never mind the smut on your left cheek,”
she would say. “It’s only another person
come to apply for a job as waitress, and she’s
much too untidy herself to notice a small
smut.”</p>

<p>Or, “This time you must take off your
apron, Betty. It’s Prexy&mdash;he says he’ll only
keep you a minute, but it’s important.”</p>

<p class="p2b">Or, “A strange looking freak of a girl,
Betty. If she hadn’t acted so completely
scared, I’d have said you couldn’t be bothered.
She looked as if she might jump into the next
county if I suggested taking you her message.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="350" alt="““YOU MUST TAKE OFF YOUR APRON”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“YOU MUST TAKE OFF YOUR APRON”</p>

<p class="p2">And each time Betty smilingly hopped off
her chair, greeted her visitor as cordially as if
she was not feeling&mdash;to quote Mary Brooks&mdash;exactly
like a cross between a reckless ritherum
and a distracted centipede, and got back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>to her shelves as soon as she could possibly
manage it, stopping on the way to encourage
Mr. Morton, hurry Madeline, and warn Jim
to wipe the dishes dry.</p>

<p>“Everything must be spick and span,” she
insisted, “to start us off right.”</p>

<p>At last Jim called “Four-forty-five, Betty,”
and she jumped down again and ran to her
room&mdash;the only place in the house that hadn’t
been settled a bit&mdash;to dress. But she was so
tired that she ended by unceremoniously borrowing
Eleanor’s fur coat to put on over her
mussy linen dress, and ordered Jonas to take
her for a restful little spin up Elm Street.
And so she managed to be all smiles and
sparkles and pretty speeches of welcome for
the matron, who was a nice motherly lady
with the loveliest snow-white hair, and a
sense of humor that twinkled out of her blue
eyes and discovered everything comical about
Betty&mdash;even to the mussy linen under the
borrowed elegance&mdash;before Jonas had seen to
the baggage and rushed his passengers up to
Morton Hall.</p>

<p>As Betty opened the door shrieks of mirth
floated out to them from the matron’s rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Excuse me one minute, Mrs. Post,” she
said hastily, “while I see if everything is
ready for you.”</p>

<p>The whole company of “Settlers,” as Madeline
called them, not excepting the under-janitor
and the night-watchman, were gathered
in Mrs. Post’s cozy sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” demanded Jim eagerly,
when Betty appeared.</p>

<p>“Didn’t she come after all?” asked Georgia
disappointedly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ready the loveliest chorus of
welcome,” explained Madeline, with a complacent
wave of the hand at her fellow
workers. “A Settlers’ Chorus, with solos by
some of the most distinguished Settlers. Now,
Betty, don’t look so horrified. Any sensible
matron will be tremendously flattered by such
a unique attention.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly respectable, Betty,” Mary
Brooks Hinsdale assured her, “and Mr. Morton
and Mr. Watson and the night-watchman
will never have another chance to be in a
Harding show.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Mr. Morton,
who had been so engrossed in studying his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>part that he had not noticed Betty’s arrival.
“I’ve heard a great deal about Harding
shows, but I certainly never expected to be in
a troupe. Bring on your audience, Miss B. A.,
or I shall forget my lines.”</p>

<p>There was no use arguing. “All right,”
agreed Betty, “only please remember that
she’s a stranger to Harding ways, and don’t
do anything to shock her too much. While
the entertainment is going on, I’ll make us
all some tea.”</p>

<p>But nobody would listen to that proposition
for a minute. Betty, being herself chief
Settler, must hear the Settlers’ Chorus. It
ended by Mr. Morton’s summoning Jonas to
make the tea&mdash;each Settler having unselfishly
insisted upon being the one to do it. But
Jonas was so entranced by the sight of his
master singing a doggerel stanza in praise of
the Admirable Architect, to a tune that he
fondly supposed to be “A Hot Time,” that he
let the water boil over to begin with, and
then steeped the tea until it was bitter and
had to be thrown away.</p>

<p>After Mr. Morton’s performance had been
duly applauded, the night-watchman sang to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>the Beneficent Benefactor, and Madeline sang
to the Courageous Captain, meaning Mrs.
Post herself. The Daring Defender was of
course the night-watchman, glorified by
Babbie as worthy of a gift of “salad and ice
and all things nice”&mdash;in memory of the supper
the three B’s had spilled on his head
when they were freshmen. Madeline was the
Esthetic Elevator because she hung pictures
and planned entertainments in a way to
elevate the taste of the inmates, and Betty
was the Flossy Furbelow, who sat and watched
other people work. The alphabet ended with
F, the chorus explained,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For Settlers must work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While others may rhyme.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’d have gone farther</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If there had been time.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But they had gone far enough to put Mrs.
Post at her ease with everybody. While fresh
tea was being made by the contrite Jonas, the
Settlers escorted her triumphantly over her
domain, and she praised everything and
thanked everybody and seemed to fit so
beautifully into the niche she had come to fill
that Betty fairly danced with relief and excitement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
If only the girls caught the right
spirit as easily!</p>

<p>But of course some of them didn’t. There
was the Thorn, who roomed on the ground
floor next to Betty, and who ran in twenty
times during the first week to make an absurd
complaint or ask an impossible favor.
There was the Mystery up in her tower; she
locked herself in so ostentatiously that she
offended her next door neighbor, who
promptly announced her intention of leaving
such a “cliquey” house. There was the Goop,
whose table manners were only equaled by
the fine disorder of her apartment. She had
been assigned to a double room, but she had
to be tactfully transferred to a single, on the
tearful complaint of her roommate; and more
tactfully urged to pick up her possessions, and
not to eat with her knife. Then there were
the Twin Digs, to whom the ten o’clock rule
was as if it had never been, and the Romantic
Miss, who professed bland and giggling innocence
in regard to campus rules about gentlemen
callers. Jim named them all, except the
Mystery, in the last confidential chat that he
and Betty had together, and he made her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>promise solemnly to keep him informed of
their escapades.</p>

<p>“For I feel like a sort of Dutch uncle to all
the Morton Hall-ites,” he explained. “May
I run up once in a while to see how you are
getting on?”</p>

<p>“May you? Will you?” was Betty’s enthusiastic
response.</p>

<p>“There might be some little changes,” went
on Jim boldly. “The only real test of a
house is to live in it a while. If there is anything
that doesn’t suit, you’ll let me know?”</p>

<p>Betty promised to do that also, and Jim departed,
divided between encouragement at
Betty’s cordial invitation and her promise to
write, and a conviction that before he had
shut the door she had forgotten his very existence
in rapt absorption in her official plans
and perplexities.</p>

<p>The housewarming was a “Madelineish”
success&mdash;that was foreordained&mdash;in spite of
the Mystery’s refusal to attend it, the Thorn’s
loud declaration that it was an absurd idea,
and the Goop’s first using part of her costume
for a dusting cloth and then losing it all in
the unfathomable depths under her bed. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>course it was absurd&mdash;deliciously absurd&mdash;the
Thanksgiving of the Purple Indians. The
Purple Indians lived in blue tents in the
depths of a pink forest. Their clothes were
travesties of the latest shades and modes.
They were thankful for the beautiful color-scheme
of their world, for the seclusion and
leisure of their lives. Presently they were
discovered by a band of New Women, who
converted them to suffrage, dress-reform, and
the pursuit of culture, and marched them off
to a Female College where they could live to
learn&mdash;not to eat and to dress. There were
sly local hits at the doll fad, the faculty’s
latest diversions, the department societies, the
frivolities of Harding life in general.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions the Morton Hall
girls entered into the affair with spirit, making
friends over the rehearsals and committee
meetings, displaying much executive ability,
and encouraging Betty to feel that in spite of
some small disappointments in the character
of a few of those who had been chosen, most
of the Morton Hall-ites were fine girls, well
worthy the help they were receiving in such
generous measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>The Mystery fully justified her title. She
was a bundle of contradictions. In spite of
her curious craving for isolation, she seemed
hungry for friendship and sympathy. She
was painfully anxious for a part in the play
and surprised Madeline by suggesting a clever
little scene to be added to it; but all of a sudden
she declared the scene would be too silly,
refused to write it out, and was with difficulty
persuaded to keep her part in the performance.</p>

<p>She seemed to have made no friends in her
three years of college life, and she assured
Betty forlornly that there was no one she
cared to ask to the play. But when Betty
told Binks Ames, and Binks humbly begged
for an invitation, the Mystery acted frightened
and embarrassed, and disappeared the
minute the play was over, leaving Binks
to spend the rest of the evening as best she
might.</p>

<p>“I think she’s your kind,” Betty told
Mrs. Post. “I’ll poke up the Goop and console
the Thorn, if you’ll try to clear up the
Mystery&mdash;and cheer her up too.”</p>

<p>So Esther Bond found herself repeatedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>invited into Mrs. Post’s cheerful little sitting-room
for tea and a good talk in the dusk of
the afternoon. Often just before ten Mrs.
Post would tap on the tower room door, and
step in for a cheerful inquiry about “lessons”
and a friendly good-night. At first the
Mystery resented these intrusions as spying on
her jealously guarded seclusion. She accepted
Mrs. Post’s invitations sulkily because she
could not well refuse, and sat, glum and silent,
in the chair farthest from her hostess, as
though intent on preventing all intruders
from scaling her wall of reserve.</p>

<p>But gradually she melted. Mrs. Post was
so friendly, so impervious to sulks and melancholy.
It was so evident that her interest
had nothing to do with curiosity&mdash;that she
knew and cared nothing about the Mystery’s
place in the college world. Best of all, she
never referred to the Mystery’s habit of locking
her door; she might never have noticed
it from her unconscious manner.</p>

<p>One night the Mystery sat down quite close
to Mrs. Post, and the feeling of intimacy that
comes from sitting close together in the firelight
unsealed her lips. She told Mrs. Post
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>about her lonely childhood spent on her
grandfather’s farm.</p>

<p>“He was awfully poor,” she explained.
“The farm was mortgaged, and everything
was old and forlorn and coming to pieces.
Once the Humane Society officers arrested
him for driving a lame horse to town. I
was with him. I remember how ashamed I
was. I begged him to let me go back and
live with my mother. Then at last he told
me that mother was dead, and that my father
had treated her cruelly and had refused to
take care of her ‘brats.’ I shall never forget
the sting of that word. It drowned out the
shame of being arrested for cruelty to animals.
Well, the next year the mortgage was foreclosed
and the farm sold. The shame of that
killed my grandfather. My grandmother
went to the poorhouse, and I went to work
for a family in the village, where I could
earn my board and have a chance to go to
school. I used to think I’d like to teach.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can in a year more,” Mrs. Post
told her cheerfully. “It’s a noble calling.”</p>

<p>“I shall hate it all the same,” declared the
Mystery fiercely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t, child,” Mrs. Post told
her, patting her shoulder gently. “You
mustn’t quarrel with your bread and butter.
Who sends you to Harding?”</p>

<p>“A woman I worked for once at home pays
part of my expenses. I shall return it all as
soon as I can. That’s all I shall have to
work for now,” she added bitterly, “except
bread and butter. My grandmother died
when I was a freshman.”</p>

<p>“Just let me read you the last letter I had
from my daughter, who is a nurse,” Mrs. Post
would say at this stage of the Mystery’s confidences.
“Or no,” after a minute’s vain
search for her reading glasses, “you read it
to me, dear.”</p>

<p>The daughter who was a nurse was a cheerful,
placid creature, with a simple, optimistic
belief in the joy of life and the nobility of
her profession. The Mystery enjoyed the
letters in spite of herself, and was divided
between contempt and envy of the writer.</p>

<p>One night the Mystery crept shamefacedly
down from her lonely tower just to kiss Mrs.
Post good-night. She found that good lady
in a state of joyous excitement over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>engagement of the daughter who was a stenographer.</p>

<p>“She is the oldest of the family,” she explained.
“She’s helped me, and helped keep
the other girls in school, and given Bella
nearly all the money she needed for her
nurse’s course. She’s worked hard, and she
has never complained. Now I hope she can
have a nice easy time.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the Mystery heartily. “And,
Mrs. Post, I’m going to try not to complain
and not to hate so many people and things.
Maybe I can find a bright side to life if I try.
I guess you think I’m a grumbler, but I’ve
had a lot to make me one.”</p>

<p>“I know you have, dear,” Mrs. Post told
her soothingly.</p>

<p>But the Mystery shook her head. “No,
you don’t know, dear lady. Nobody knows.
I’ve never told you the real big trouble&mdash;I
couldn’t. Good-night.”</p>

<p>To Betty the Mystery continued cold and
forbidding, and Betty wisely decided to leave
her to Mrs. Post.</p>

<p>“There are people I don’t especially like,”
she reflected, “and of course there are people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>who don’t like me. The Mystery is evidently
one of them. I must write Jim and tell him
what a hit his tower room makes with her,
even if I can’t get near her.”</p>

<span class="smaller">GHOSTS AND INSPIRATIONS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> snowy afternoon in December Dorothy,
looking like a snowbird in her gray coat
powdered with big white flakes, flitted into
Betty’s room and without giving her sister a
chance to say “How do you do?” burst out
with her great news.</p>

<p>“There’s such an excitement at school.
Miss Dick just laughs, but Kitty Carson
thinks it was burglars, and we girls all think
it was a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, what a beautiful excitement!”
laughed Betty. “Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see Shirley Ware heard it first,”
explained Dorothy, “and she was so scared
that she tried to scream. And all that came
out was a kind of a choke. It woke me up
and then I heard it too&mdash;the other noise, I
mean. It was a queer little scratching and
knocking on the wall.”</p>

<p>“Mice, you silly child,” put in Betty wisely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>But Dorothy scorned such a theory. “I
guess I know how mice sound, after all I
heard this summer, scurrying and hurrying
inside our cottage walls. Besides, mice don’t
groan, Betty Wales. The next thing we
heard was a groan&mdash;an awfully sad sound,
you know, Betty. It scared me so that I tried
to scream too, and the other two girls woke
up. They said I only made a little squeak,”
explained the Smallest Sister proudly, “and
of course if I had really screamed Kitty
Carson would have heard, for all she sleeps
so sound.”</p>

<p>“And what did the ghost do then?” asked
Betty.</p>

<p>“It just groaned once more louder than
ever, and then it stopped, and everything was
just awfully still. So I got into bed with
Sarah and Helen, and I s’pose I went to sleep.
But Shirley was so scared that she couldn’t
move, and she stayed awake and saw it.”</p>

<p>“You mean she was so scared that she imagined
that she saw it, dearie,” Betty amended.
“There aren’t any ghosts, you know, really
and truly, Dottie.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are burglars,” Dorothy insisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“and anyway, it wasn’t a mouse.
And what Shirley saw was a tall white ghost
with its hands over its face&mdash;so.” Dorothy
illustrated graphically. “And in the morning
we told Miss Dick, and she laughed, but
Kitty Carson’s window has a fire-escape, and
she sleeps so sound that anybody could go in
and out that way. We know she is just as
scared as we are because there’s a man come
this very afternoon to put bars on her
window.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you’ll be quite safe to-night,”
Betty assured her comfortably. “Didn’t I
ever tell you about our Scotch ghosts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but please do it again,” begged
Dorothy, “because I’ve most forgotten, and
then I can tell the girls. We’re so interested
in ghosts just now.”</p>

<p>So Betty told about the ghost that Madeline
and Mr. Dwight had invented to add the
finishing touch to Babbie’s ancestral castle at
Oban. “Ghosts that little girls see are always
like that,” she ended, “just jokes that somebody
has played for fun. If Shirley really saw
anything it was some big girl who’d dressed
up on purpose to frighten you little ones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“It couldn’t be.” The Smallest Sister’s
tone was very positive. “There’s a chimney
next to our wall on Shirley’s side where the
noises were. No girl could crawl up a
chimney. Nothing could get there but a
ghost.”</p>

<p>“Or a mouse,” interpolated Betty sceptically.</p>

<p>“Mice don’t groan,” Dorothy reminded her.
“If it was a girl&mdash;but it couldn’t be, because
how could a girl get in the chimney?&mdash;and
Miss Dick ever finds out who it was, why, I
shouldn’t care to be in her shoes, I just guess!
Shirley got so scared it made her sick. She’s
gone to the infirmary to-day.”</p>

<p>“When she comes back you’d better put
your cot near to hers, so she can reach out
and wake you if she’s ever frightened again,”
Betty advised. “It was selfish of you three
to get into one bed and leave her alone.”</p>

<p>“She could have come if she’d wanted to,”
the Smallest Sister defended herself. “We
s’posed she wasn’t a bit afraid when she stayed
where she was, instead of her being too afraid
to move.”</p>

<p>“Well, next time be more thoughtful,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>Betty cautioned, and the Smallest Sister
promised, and prepared to hop-skip back to
school.</p>

<p>“Frisky and I walk together this week”&mdash;she
explained her brief visit&mdash;“so I don’t
want to miss a single walk. I can go walking
with you next week. Yes, I do hate two-and-two
school walks ’most as much as ever
I did, but it’s different when I can walk with
Frisky. I’ll come again soon and tell you
what we’ve discovered about the ghost,” she
called over her shoulder, as she vanished.</p>

<p>That evening the Thorn appeared in Betty’s
room, wearing her most provoking air&mdash;a
combination of sympathy for Betty, offended
dignity for herself, and a grim pleasure in
showing up the shortcomings and inferiorities
of her house mates.</p>

<p>“How did Mr. J. J. Morton make all his
money?” she inquired, after a few moments’
acrid criticism of the Purple Indian play,
which had just been successfully repeated, by
request, for the benefit of the Student’s Aid
treasury.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know exactly,” Betty answered
idly. “Railroads, I think, and&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>stocks and bonds. The same way other rich
men have made their money, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s tainted millions, all right.”
The Thorn’s thin lips shut tight, and her
sharp eyes fixed Betty’s belligerently.</p>

<p>Betty only smiled at her good-humoredly.
“Did you read Peggy Swift’s article in the
last ‘Argus’ on that subject? She makes you
see how all money is tainted, in a way. But
Mr. Morton is as fair and upright as he can
be. He is splendid to the men who work for
him, Mr. Thayer says. And he spends most
of his time nowadays in superintending his
charities.”</p>

<p>“When he isn’t spending it squeezing some
small competitor to the wall, or whitewashing
a corner,” added the Thorn sententiously.</p>

<p>Betty considered this speech in bewildered
silence. Her ideas of political economy were
very hazy. Was it always wrong to get rid
of competition, if you were smart enough to
do it? she wondered. What in the world did
a “corner” have to do with tainted money,
and why should Mr. Morton be blamed for
any interest he might have in a thing as innocent
and necessary as whitewash?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d have anything to
say to that,” the Thorn proceeded triumphantly,
after a minute. “Besides, I’ve got
proof of every word I say. We aren’t going
to be happy in this house. It’s haunted&mdash;by
the spirits of those he has wronged, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Matilda Thorn&mdash;I mean Jones,” began
Betty, letting Jim’s name pop out before she
thought, in her annoyance, “don’t be so
ridiculous. I can’t argue about Mr. Morton’s
business methods because I don’t know
enough about them, and neither do you. But
President Wallace does, and he accepted this
house very gladly for Harding College. Furthermore,
you accepted a place in it very
gladly&mdash;yours was the first name on my list.
So I think it is very inconsistent of you, as
well as very ungracious, to criticize Mr. Morton
now. But when you talk about this
house being haunted you are simply making
yourself ridiculous. Please explain what you
mean by saying such a thing.”</p>

<p>The Thorn listened to Betty’s stern arraignment
with growing amazement. She
had “sized up” the new secretary as “one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>the pretty, easy-going kind,” and had vastly
enjoyed worrying her with ill-grounded complaints,
which had always been treated with a
sweet seriousness that the Thorn had found
very diverting. Now she realized that she
had gone too far, and she rose to retreat,
rallying her scattered forces into a semblance
of order.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I’ve offended you, Miss
Wales,” she said humbly. “I didn’t remember
that Mr. Morton was a friend of
yours. I haven’t any friends of his sort&mdash;he
seems to belong in another world from mine.
I didn’t mean to be rude&mdash;or ungrateful&mdash;or
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>Betty held out her hand impulsively.
Being perfectly sincere and simple herself,
she could never have guessed at the strange
complexity of motives that actuated the
Thorn. “Then if you didn’t mean it, it’s all
right,” she said. “So please sit down and
tell me what you think Mr. Morton has done
that isn’t honest, and I’ll ask him about it&mdash;or
I’ll ask President Wallace to explain it to
us. And then tell me what makes you say
that Morton Hall is haunted.” Betty’s sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>of humor nearly overcame her dignity at this
point, and the last word ended in a chuckle
that she hastily converted into a cough.
Ghosts seemed to be dogging her path to-day.</p>

<p>The Thorn sat down again majestically.
“Well,” she began uncertainly, “I’m not
sure that I know anything in particular
about Mr. Morton’s methods. All great fortunes
are founded on trickery, in my opinion.
A great many other people seem to think so
too, according to all that you read. And
when the girls on the top floor began to hear
ghosts walking and talking and unlocking
locked doors, why, I suppose I put two and
two together&mdash;that’s all. Some way you always
associate ghosts with wicked men. Of
course it might be Miss Bond who was
haunted, instead of Mr. Morton’s money.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Jones,” broke in Betty in
amazement, “you don’t really believe in
ghosts, do you? My little sister has just
been here with a story of how some of Miss
Dick’s girls were frightened last night by
mysterious noises. It’s bad enough for children
as big as she is to think they’ve seen
ghosts, but for Harding girls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>The Thorn shrugged her shoulders dubiously.
“That’s what I said myself when I
first heard about it, but yesterday in evening
study-hour I was up there, and we certainly
heard the queerest whisperings and mutterings
coming from the tower room. We were
sure Miss Bond was in there alone, so we
knocked to see if she was sick or wanted anything.
She didn’t answer, and we finally
tried the door and it was locked, as usual.
So we banged and banged, and we were just
going to call Mrs. Post when Miss Bond
finally came&mdash;and she was all alone and
hadn’t been studying elocution or reading her
Lit. out loud. She said she hadn’t heard anything
either, except the racket we made, but
I noticed she didn’t act much as if she meant
it. She’s so secretive she’d keep even a ghost
to herself, probably,” ended the Thorn vindictively.</p>

<p>Betty advanced the mice-in-the-walls
theory, only to have it scoffed aside, with a
variation of the Smallest Sister’s argument:
“Mice do not whisper and mutter; they
scramble and squeak.” She suggested that
the sounds came from another study; that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>had been carefully investigated. She hastily
dismissed the suspicion that the Mystery had
misled them about being alone. In the first
place she felt sure that the Mystery was
honest; in the second place the Thorn, as if
reading her thoughts, explained how they
had hunted through the closet and even
looked under the bed.</p>

<p>“Well, you will have to keep your ghosts,
then,” Betty laughed finally. “Only don’t
throw the blame on poor Mr. Morton or on
Miss Bond, who didn’t hear anything. Why,
maybe it’s you they’re haunting. The people
who hear things are the ones to worry about
being responsible, I should say.”</p>

<p>The Thorn refused to turn the matter into a
pleasantry. “They’ve all heard the noises,”
she explained, “the girls who room on the
third floor. They asked me to come up last
night and see what I thought.”</p>

<p>“And then speak to me?” asked Betty,
annoyed that the Thorn should have been
honored with an official mission.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;if I thought best,” the Thorn admitted.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Betty cheerfully. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>can tell them what I’ve said&mdash;particularly
what I think about the silliness of believing
in ghosts. If they are troubled by any more
noises, they can let me or Mrs. Post know,
and we’ll look into it.”</p>

<p>“People do get the queerest ideas into their
heads,” she sighed, when the Thorn had departed.
“To-day it’s ghosts, ghosts everywhere,
and to-morrow it will be something
else.”</p>

<p>To-morrow’s trouble, as it proved when
to-morrow came, was inspirations. Babbie
had one&mdash;quite unrelated of course to the fact
that she and Mr. Thayer could not agree
about the prettiest furnishings for a library&mdash;to
the effect that her mother was lonely and
needed the society of her only child. And
Madeline had one, which took the form of a
plot for a drama that was certain to make
Broadway “sit up and take notice.”</p>

<p>“But, Madeline,” Betty begged, “you can
write that later. It’s getting very close to
Christmas. You’ve got to take charge of the
Tally-ho’s gift-shop department again. The
Morton Hall girls will help, but they’re no
good at planning. And neither am I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Make the things we planned last year,”
suggested Madeline promptly.</p>

<p>“You know that won’t do, Madeline,”
Betty told her sternly. “All our best customers
have bought dozens of extra-special
candle-shades and Cupid cards and stenciled
blotters. We can have some of those, for
freshmen or girls who didn’t get around to
buy last year. But it will all seem stale and
left over and silly if we don’t have some
grand new specialties. Please, Madeline!”</p>

<p>Madeline frowned darkly and shook her
head. “Ever since that tea-shop was started,
I have sacrificed my Literary Career to its
needs. Now I revolt. I’m going to write
my play while I’m in the mood. If I should
finish before Christmas, why, then I’ll help
with the gift-shop business, not otherwise.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” sighed Betty. “The
gift-shop pays splendidly. We can’t let it go,
because if we do we shall make less money
than we did last year, and then Mrs. Hildreth
and Mrs. Bob would be disappointed. Besides,
I’ve been promising some of my girls a
regular harvest from it.”</p>

<p>“Mary Brooks invented a pretty candle-shade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
last year,” Madeline reminded her.
“Tell her that she’s the Perfect Patron, and
must dress the part. Command her to come
to the rescue of the gift-shop.”</p>

<p>“I shall ask her to come and talk to you,”
Betty murmured under her breath.</p>

<p>But even Mary’s lively arguments left
Madeline unmoved.</p>

<p>“If it was an order that you’d had for a
play,” Mary told her calmly, “I wouldn’t
say a word. But you’re only wasting your
time on a forlorn hope, just when you might
be doing something really useful. I shall
cross my thumbs at you and your old play.”</p>

<p>“You may cross your thumbs all you want
to,” Madeline defied her smilingly. “Before
the winter is over you’ll be sitting in a box at
my Broadway opening&mdash;that is, if I’m magnanimous
enough to ask you, after all the
beautiful encouragement you’re giving me.”</p>

<p>“But, Madeline”&mdash;Mary was nothing if not
persistent&mdash;“what makes you think you can
write a play, when all your stories have come
back, except a few of those college ones? A
play is any amount harder to write than a
short story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Madeline smiled back at her confidently.
“Maybe I agree with you, little Mary. But
in the first place every Tom, Dick and Harry
is writing good short stories nowadays, and
nobody is writing extra good plays. In the
second place, I have discovered the secret of
writing natural but amusing dialogue.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you know all there is to be
known about stage-craft,” added Mary, in her
most sarcastic tones.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen every good thing in New York
ever since I could talk,” Madeline announced
calmly. “Besides, I am going down to New
York later to look up the stage business. But
first I’m going to get the play all written.
I’m afraid the original touch would tumble
out if I carried it to New York in my head.
And then,” she added mysteriously, “I
couldn’t use my secret method about dialogue
so well in New York.”</p>

<p>“Madeline Ayres,” Mary told her solemnly,
“you are the most provoking person I know.
You have mooned around here all the fall,
doing footless little stunts for anybody that
asked you. Now, when Betty and the Tally-ho
need you, you are under the spell of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>most untimely inspiration that I’ve ever heard
of your having.”</p>

<p>“I guess the Vagabonds would like to hear
you call the Pageant I wrote for them footless,”
declared Madeline in injured tones,
“and if any college play ever took better than
the Purple Indians&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course your stunts are all perfectly
lovely,” Mary hastened to assure her.
“You’re the most provoking but also pretty
nearly the most interesting of all the B. C. A.’s.
Isn’t she, Betty? I’ll cross my thumbs for
your play instead of against it, Madeline.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Madeline briefly. “I’m
writing it for Agatha Dwight.”</p>

<p>Betty and Mary exchanged glances of utter
amazement. Agatha Dwight was the idol of
Harding and of two continents besides. The
leading playwrights of England and America
wrote for her, and the greatest of them felt
highly honored when her capricious taste
singled out a piece of his for production.</p>

<p>“And the moral of that is,” said Mary at
last, “aim at a star, because it’s no disgrace if
you miss her. Pun not noticed until it was
too late to withdraw the epigram. Come on,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>Betty, and fix up the workroom. It’s lucky
that George Garrison Hinsdale is writing
another of his horribly learned papers this
month, so I can be down here as much as I
like. This one is on the aberrations of Genius.
I shall suggest untimely inspirations as an important
subhead, and invite Madeline up to
discuss it with him. Meanwhile our only
hope is that she’ll get sick of her play and
come to our rescue, and do you know, Betty
Wales, I shall be most desperately disappointed
if she does.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I suppose she oughtn’t to
waste her time on fussy little things like
gift-shop specialties if she can really do big
things like plays for Agatha Dwight. But
she is so splendid at everything.”</p>

<p>“And the moral of that is,” said Mary, “be
splendid at everything and you’ll be wanted,
no matter how provoking you are at times.
I should like to have been a genius myself,
only George Garrison Hinsdale says he prefers
near-geniuses as wives. Now, Betty Wales,
what do you say to a ploshkin candle-shade
for this year’s extra-special feature?”</p>

<span class="smaller">WHAT CHRISTMAS REALLY MEANS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Terrible Ten began it. Eleanor Watson
had forgotten to bring either peanuts or
taffy to their class, and the Arithmetic lesson
flagged in consequence, until finally, in despair,
she sent Rafael out to buy some refreshments.</p>

<p>“How’s your father to-night, Pietro?”
she asked, while they waited. Pietro Senior
had slipped on the ice on his way home from
work and sprained his wrist badly.</p>

<p>“Better, I tink,” Pietro reported stolidly,
his thoughts all on peanuts to come.</p>

<p>“Dat’s nottings&mdash;lit’ wrist splain,” Giuseppi
announced. “My fader, he had a hand
cut off&mdash;so.”</p>

<p>“My fader go to de hospital. Hava big
cutting.” Nicolo illustrated a “big cutting”
vividly with a dangerous swing of his villainous-looking
jack-knife.</p>

<p>“My moder she hava two operations dis
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“My sister she have tree.”</p>

<p>Rafael had arrived during the debate, but
not even the bag of peanuts he set down before
Eleanor could distract attention from the
bitter rivalry in misfortune. In a minute
Rafael too had caught the trend of it.</p>

<p>“Waita lil minute,” he cried, glowering angrily
round the circle. “Looka my hand.
Dat’s one. My lil sister she died dis year.
My muvver she go to hospital. And my big
sister, she work to Cannon’s fer der Christmas
trade. She say she rather die, she so
tired every night, an’ it get worse an’ worse
an’ worse every day till it be Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Dat so,” agreed Pietro solemnly. “My
sister she work dar too. Doan get home till
ten, leben o’clock.”</p>

<p>Cannon’s was the big cheap department
store down near the station. Eleanor took
mental note of the Ten’s opinion of its treatment
of employees, and resolved to ask Mr.
Thayer if the girls who worked there really
had such a hard time as their small brothers
thought. Meanwhile she stopped the ridiculous
operation contest with many peanuts.
The Ten, being very bright boys, though ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
of books, had speedily discovered that
the bigger numbers you could add right, the
faster you could secure large quantities of
peanuts. Also, they humbly worshipped the
Lovely Lady, whom Rafael had refused to let
them call “de peach.” They came regularly
to their class, they listened spellbound to
the adventures of Robin Hood, they wrote
the names of Robin and all his band&mdash;also
their own and the Lovely Lady’s&mdash;without
a slip, and when Eleanor declared that nothing
would make her so happy as to hear
them read the tale of King Arthur and his
knights to her out of a book, they set themselves
at learning “dose queer book letters”
with a will.</p>

<p>“First fellah dat bothers my Lovely Lada,
I fixa him,” Rafael had announced at the end
of the third lesson.</p>

<p>“Why she your lovely lada?” demanded
Pietro mockingly, dodging behind a telegraph
pole for safety.</p>

<p>“’Cause I lika her de most,” Rafael declared,
“and she goan lika me de most. You
jus’ wait.”</p>

<p>But after that one assertion of proprietorship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
he changed “my” to “the,” and impressed
the revision upon his friends and
followers with terrible threats. Rafael’s eyes
were brown and melting, his voice was of a
liquid softness, his smile as sunny as the
skies of his native land. But when he
scowled all the fierceness of Sicilian feuds
and vendettas flashed out of his deep eyes
and straightened his mouth into a cruel,
hard line. No wonder the Ten shivered and
cowered before the wrath of Rafael, supplemented
by the flash of a sharp little dagger
that Eleanor, who had been entirely reassured
by Mr. Thayer, little suspected the dearest of
her dear, curly-haired comical Ten to be carrying
inside his gray shirt.</p>

<p>After the class that evening, Eleanor asked
Mr. Thayer about Cannon’s.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose they are pretty hard on
their girls,” he said. “Standing up all day
waiting on tired, irritable customers who
have to make every penny count, with fifteen
minutes off for lunch in the busy season,
can’t be exactly fun. Then in the evening I
suppose they have to go back to straighten up
their stock of goods, move things around to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>show them off better, trim up the windows,
and so on. Christmas means something quite
different from a gay holiday with a big dinner
and a lot of pretty presents to those girls
and to lots of others, Miss Watson. If the
Christmas rush is bad at Cannon’s, it must
be perfect torture in the big city shops.”</p>

<p>Next day Eleanor persuaded Madeline, who
could always be detached from her work to
investigate a real novelty, to go with her to
Cannon’s.</p>

<p>“If we want to ask the clerks any questions,
you can do it safely in Italian, or any
other language,” Eleanor urged. “They’re
mostly foreigners, I think.”</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “And I might find the
type&mdash;&mdash;” Her voice trailed off into silence,
and her face wore a far-away, inscrutable look.
Writing a play for Miss Dwight certainly
made a person very absent-minded, and one’s
conversation very inconsecutive&mdash;also one’s
actions. Madeline suddenly decided to buy a
hat, and dragged Eleanor from one shop to
another without finding anything to please
her difficult taste, so that it was almost dark
when they reached Cannon’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>The big store was packed with shoppers.
The air was clammy and stale; the counters
were a mass of soiled and dingy merchandise.
Tiny cash-girls ran wearily to and fro, elbowing
a difficult way through the jam in the
narrow aisles. Behind the counters pale-faced
clerks eyed the customers savagely, and
attended with languid insolence to their
wants.</p>

<p>Eleanor sniffed the air daintily. “What
an awful place, Madeline! Where do all
these shoppers come from? I don’t feel a bit
as if I were in Harding.”</p>

<p>“From Factory Hill, I suppose, and from
across the tracks where the French settlement
is. Let’s go to the toy department and buy
Fluffy a doll. I’m sure they’ll have something
unique to add to her collection.”</p>

<p>Eleanor stood near the door, hesitating.
“It’s horribly smelly. You don’t think we
shall catch anything, do you?”</p>

<p>Madeline laughed. “You’d never do to go
really and truly slumming, Eleanor. No, we
shan’t catch anything, probably. Come along.
I thought you wanted to investigate this
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>So Eleanor bravely “came along.” They
bought a penny doll for Fluffy, from a sad-eyed
little clerk who told them she was
“tired most to death working nights,” and
then, when a floor-walker appeared suddenly
from around a corner, took it all back and declared
loudly that business was fine this year
and she liked the rush of “somethin’ doin’.”</p>

<p>On the way down-stairs&mdash;Eleanor had
firmly refused to get into one of Cannon’s
elevators&mdash;they came upon a girl crying bitterly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Madeline asked in
the friendly, companionable way that always
got her answers.</p>

<p>“I’ve been fined again,” the girl sobbed.
“Ten cents ain’t so much, but neither is four
dollars. That’s what I get. I’ve been fined
three times this week. What for? Why,
once for being late in the morning&mdash;it’s
awful easy to sleep over when you’ve been
working late at night&mdash;and once for sitting
down on the ledge behind the counter. It’s
against the rules to sit down, you know.
And this time it was for talking back to an
inspector who said my check was wrong. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>wasn’t. If it had been, I’d have been fined
for that.”</p>

<p>Eleanor had been hunting through her
pocketbook.</p>

<p>“Please take this,” she said, “and don’t
cry any more. Can’t you get off to-night and
have a good rest?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head vigorously, smiling
at Eleanor through her tears. “I’d lose my
job like that, ma’am. I ain’t any worse off
than the others; only it did make me sick to
lose the money when I got so many depending
on me&mdash;my old grandmother and two kid
brothers&mdash;and I wanted to make a little
Christmas for the kids. Thank you an awful
lot, ma’am.”</p>

<p>The girls went on their way fairly bursting
with indignation.</p>

<p>“The idea of fining her for sitting down to
rest!” sputtered Madeline. “And for being
late, when she’s worked half the night before,
it’s outrageous!”</p>

<p>Eleanor had quite forgotten the odors and
the risk of infection. “Let’s buy some ribbon,”
she suggested. “That counter seems to
be the hub of the shopping fray.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>So they bought ribbon of a dark-eyed, dark-haired
beauty who proved to be Pietro’s sister.
She beamed on Eleanor, and in the safe
foreign tongue confided to Madeline that
Cannon’s was certainly a bad place to work.
She could look out for herself, she explained,
flashing an imperious glance at an inspector.
She brought in lots of Italian trade, and could
interpret both in Italian and French for the
women who hadn’t learned English. So they
treated her better. Oh, they fined her, of
course&mdash;that was the rule&mdash;and she worked
most nights. But she was pretty sure of keeping
her place, whatever happened. That was
a big help. They should see the dirty hole
of a lunch-room before they left, she called
gleefully after them, under the very eye of
the fat little man whom she had pointed out as
Mr. Cannon. It was certainly “a big help” to
be able to utter wholesome truths like that
with impunity.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and reason with him,” suggested
Madeline, looking angrily after the fat little
proprietor. “Let’s make him take us to see
the dirty hole of a rest-room. Let’s threaten
to boycott him if he doesn’t reform his ways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Eleanor looked very much frightened.
“We should only get the girls we’ve talked
to into trouble. The boycott wouldn’t work
because we’ve never bought anything anyway
until to-day. I&mdash;I think I’m beginning to
feel faint, Madeline. Let’s go home and talk
it over with Betty and Mr. Thayer. They’ll
think of just the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Thayer had gone to Boston, via
Babbie Hildreth’s, and it was Eugenia Ford’s
plan that, after much discussion, was settled
upon, for the reason, as Madeline put it, that
it was “just wild enough to work.”</p>

<p>So after chapel the next morning Eugenia,
Georgia, and Fluffy&mdash;Straight had tearfully
decided not to cut Logic&mdash;chaperoned by
Betty, appeared at Cannon’s and asked to see
the head of the firm.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Cannon,” said Georgia
in businesslike tones, when he appeared.
“We’ve got a proposition to make to you.
We three are Harding girls, and this is Miss
Wales, secretary of the Student’s Aid Society,&mdash;also
proprietor of the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Charmed to meet you, I’m
sure.” The fat little man bowed low and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>smiled a fatuous, oily smile. “Anything I
can do in the way of canned goods, crackers,
sweets&mdash;to the sweet, ladies.” He bowed and
smiled again.</p>

<p>“We want to ask a favor,” pursued Georgia,
utterly ignoring his courtesies. “We all
have pretty good times generally, and very
merry Christmases. We want other girls to
have the same. We have just lately realized
how hard it is for salespeople just at this time
of year&mdash;how Christmas means to them just
terribly hard work for little or no extra pay&mdash;and
we want to help at least a few of them.
So we’ve gotten up a petition about shopping
early in the day, and early in the season, for
the Harding girls to sign. Now we also want
to arrange to come down and help some of
your girls out. We want to take the places
of three of them every day from twelve to
one, so that they can get a good rest at noon,
and also from five to six, so they can, if possible,
do any extra work they have then and
so avoid night work. If not, they can at least
start fresh for the evening.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon stared at Georgia in utter
amazement. Suddenly his fat face grew red,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>and he shouted angrily, “Who’s been talkin’
to you? You know an awful lot about my
business, don’t you, now? You’d better clear
out.”</p>

<p>“Without the canned goods and crackers
and sweets&mdash;for the sweet?” asked Fluffy
gaily, looking down at him with her fascinating,
insolent smile.</p>

<p>“We’ve talked to no one, Mr. Cannon,” put
in little Eugenia earnestly.</p>

<p>“And we mean to help you too, as is only
fair, if you are good enough to give us the
chance to help the girls,” added Betty, with
quiet dignity.</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon glowered at the circle of pretty,
serious, half-frightened faces.</p>

<p>“You don’t know nothing about clerking,”
he sputtered at last. “Nice mess you’d make
of your hours! Nice kind of help you’d hand
out to me!”</p>

<p>“I was a waitress once,” Fluffy informed
him calmly, winking at Betty. “The young
woman I worked for said I was very good at
it. Besides, all my little friends came and
patronized me. If you’ll let me try, I’ll ask
them to patronize me here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“We don’t expect pay,” Georgia explained,
“and the first day we come we’d just be
extras, watching to see what our duties would
be.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Mr. Cannon,” urged Fluffy,
who was never in the least daunted by opposition.
“We’ll accomplish more in an hour
than these poor dragged-out girls ever do&mdash;even
if we don’t understand the difficult art
of clerking,” she added maliciously. “And
they’ll do more in their afternoons, after
they’ve had a chance to rest. What you want
is your money’s worth, isn’t it? The best
service for the smallest wages. Don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here,” Mr. Cannon cut her short,
“let’s have a little talk. What did you
come here for to-day?” He pointed a pudgy
finger at Fluffy, who explained once more, in
picturesque phrases, the idea they had had in
coming to interview him.</p>

<p>“You say you’ve been a waitress?”</p>

<p>Fluffy nodded, winking solemnly again at
Betty.</p>

<p>“You’re not a labor organizer?”</p>

<p>With equal solemnity she denied the charge.</p>

<p>“Far as I can see, you’re more or less luny.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>If you want to, you can try. Come to-day at
twelve. If you get along, maybe the others
can take hold. Some o’ my girls are fagged,
for sure, and if your little friends, as you call
them, come in, that’ll help some. I’ve always
said,” added Mr. Cannon proudly, “that if I
could once get the college trade to swing my
way, I could keep it. Honest values for cash
is my motto.” And with a curt little nod he
started off.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Fluffy arrested his progress.
“You mean I’m to come and not the
others?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon nodded. “As the most likely
specimen. I don’t believe in beginning any
new experiment on too sumptoos a scale.”
This time he was irrevocably gone.</p>

<p>Fluffy wore a comical air of dismay.
“Gracious! Doing it all alone isn’t at all my
idea of a stunt. I shall be terribly scared and
lonely. Straight’s got to spend the entire
hour buying things of me. Oh, dear! She
can’t, because it’s a cash store and we haven’t
any money left. I wonder, if I should tell
him I had a twin, whether he wouldn’t let
her try to-day too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“No time,” said Georgia firmly. “Psych.
6 beckons. But you shan’t be deserted.
We’ll take up a contribution for Straight to
spend.”</p>

<p>Fluffy’s experiment in social service was
the sensation of the Harding morning.
Promptly at twelve she appeared, and was
given the place of a wan little girl behind the
ribbon counter. Ten minutes later&mdash;she had
stipulated for that interval in which to learn
how to “work” her cash-book&mdash;the “college
trade” appeared in the persons of a lively
delegation conducted by the triumphant
Straight, all eagerness to display her adored
twin in this new and exciting rôle. They
bought ribbons recklessly, with much delicious
professional encouragement from Fluffy.
They smiled cheerfully upon Mr. Cannon,
who lurked in the offing, watching the progress
of his “new experiment” with amazed
interest. Piloted by Eleanor Watson, they
ascended to the doll counter, and provided
themselves with souvenirs of the occasion in
the shape of dancing dolls which twirled fascinatingly
about a central magnet on top of a
little tin box. There had been nothing so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>nice at the regular toy store, they declared
loudly, for Mr. Cannon’s benefit. At one
they escorted the weary Fluffy triumphantly
to the Tally-ho for luncheon.</p>

<p>“He tried to hire me for all the afternoons,”
explained Fluffy proudly, “and he says the
rest of you may come, and Straight too, seeing
she’s my twin; but no more. He doesn’t
believe in trying noo experiments on too
sumptoos a scale,” mimicked Fluffy joyously.</p>

<p>A good many things besides the easing of
the lots of a few tired sales-girls came of the
“noo experiment.” One was a queer friendship
that sprang up between Fluffy and Mr.
Cannon, cemented by a compact, on Fluffy’s
part, hereafter to “trade for cash,” which Mr.
Cannon considered the only honest way of
living, and, on Mr. Cannon’s, to accept Mr.
Thayer’s offer of rooms in the club-house
where classes in embroidery and music and
some amusement clubs might be enjoyed by
Mr. Cannon’s girls. Then Madeline’s “Sunday
Special” article on the Harding girls’
practical way of helping those less fortunate
was copied and discussed through the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>country; and many women and men who
had never given the matter a thought before
realized that shop-girls are human and began
treating them as if they were.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Betty Wales, seeing another application
of the same principle, got together
the committee on the Proper Excitement of
the Idle Rich and made them a proposition.</p>

<p>“A store in New York wants two thousand
ploshkin candle-shades before Christmas.
They won’t handle less than a thousand.
Six Morton Hall girls are working their heads
off to get them ready in time&mdash;that means
that the last shipment must go by the fifteenth.
Why can’t you help them out by
having some candle-shade bees?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had a chance to do one thing
for Christmas myself,” objected Georgia sadly.</p>

<p>“Do you usually make all your presents?”
demanded Mary Brooks incisively. “You
know you never touch one of them. As the
presiding genius of the gift-shop department
and the one and only Perfect Patron of the
Tally-ho I am bound to help this Excitement
along. It’s simply absurd for you to rush
down to Cannon’s every day, and then refuse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>to help the girls in this very college who are
just as tired and just as much tied down by
this horrible Christmas tradition of buying
things all in a heap, regardless of the people
who have to make them then, or starve. The
first bee can be at my house,” ended Mary
sweetly, “and there will be perfectly good refreshments.”</p>

<p>The bees accomplished wonders, but it was
still a struggle to finish the candle-shades in
time; and when the Thorn cut her hand and
the wound got poisoned and wouldn’t heal,
things seemed nearly hopeless. But little
Eugenia Ford came nobly to the rescue.
“There’s no rule against getting up at three
in the morning,” she said, and for six consecutive
days she woke herself heroically at
that hour, and cut, pasted, and put together
candle-shades until dawn, hardly taking time
for breakfast, but never neglecting her college
work&mdash;she had learned her lesson about
that.</p>

<p>At three o’clock on the afternoon of Sunday,
the sixteenth, Eugenia hung out a busy
sign and curled up on her couch for a much
needed nap. When she woke again, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>almost dark. She had promised to go to Vespers
with Helena Mason.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m late, but she might have
called for me,” reflected Eugenia, getting
rapidly into a trailing blue broadcloth dress,
which, with a big plumed hat, silver-fox furs,
and a huge bunch of violets, was calculated to
make a very favorable impression upon the
Vespers audience.</p>

<p>When she was ready, Eugenia consulted a
diminutive watch. “Quarter to seven!”
Her expression of consternation gave way
suddenly to relief. “I remember now that it
was two hours fast. No&mdash;I changed it.
Well, it’s surely all wrong.” Eugenia dashed
down the hall to Helena Mason’s room. Her
hurried knock was answered by a rather
grudging “Come in.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry to be late,” Eugenia began
apologetically.</p>

<p>Miss Mason sat at her desk, writing busily.
She turned her head at last, and stared hard
at Eugenia.</p>

<p>“I should say you were early myself,” she
observed, “but why the plumes and the
train?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia seized a tiny alarm clock that
stood on the floor by the bed, which, for some
strange reason, was not made up&mdash;at Vespers
time on Sunday.</p>

<p>“It is quarter to seven,” she cried aghast.
“Why didn’t you call me, and why isn’t it
dark, and what do you mean by saying I’m
early for Vespers?”</p>

<p>“Eugenia Ford, are you crazy?” inquired
Miss Mason sternly.</p>

<p>Poor Eugenia looked ready to cry. “I
don’t think I am. Tell me what I’m early
for, please.”</p>

<p>“Breakfast, of course,” explained Miss
Mason. “I got up at six to copy this
theme. It’s now almost seven&mdash;there’s the
rising bell this minute. As for Vespers, now
you speak of it I do remember that you promised
to call for me, but I went to the Westcott
for dinner yesterday and to Vespers right
from there, without ever thinking of our engagement.”</p>

<p>Eugenia sank down limply on the disheveled
bed. “Then I’ve slept since three
o’clock yesterday,” she announced tragically,
“in my kimono, on top of my couch, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>know. I never heard of such a thing, did
you?”</p>

<p>The Thorn certainly never had, and she
was much impressed.</p>

<p>“I always supposed that rich girls like
Miss Ford just thought of clothes and dances
and traveling and a good time generally,”
she confided to Betty. “I never thought one
of them would wear herself out helping poor
little me. You’ve got to be pretty tired to
sleep like that. I shall always feel differently
about rich girls after this.”</p>

<p>And she kept her word. The Thorn’s
sharp point was dulled. Instead of being a
faultfinder and an agitator she threw her
influence, which for some obscure reason was
considerable, on the side of harmony and
good-fellowship.</p>

<p>“I’ve told the third floor to stop spying on
Esther Bond,” she informed Betty. “I’m
convinced myself that she studies out loud,
and for some queer reason doesn’t want
it known. She’s awfully secretive. That
Helena Mason goes up to see her quite a lot.
You’d think she’d be proud of knowing a
prominent girl like Miss Mason, but she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>smuggles her in and out as if she was a poor
relation. All the same, I guess the way she
acts is her own affair. She hasn’t said much,
but she must know she’s being watched, and
I’ve advised them all to stop it. She looks
as if she had troubles enough without that.
I’ve been reading up about ghosts, and they
do seem to be pretty much made up, specially
all those seen by several people at one time.
Did Miss Dick’s school ever find out about
theirs?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “The poor little
girl who got the most frightened by it has
been terribly ill. They thought last week
that she was going to die, but she’s much better
now.”</p>

<p>“Some other girl must be feeling pretty
bad, if it was done for a joke,” said the Thorn.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Betty, “but Miss Dick
thinks it was an accident&mdash;and little Shirley’s
strong imagination, of course. I hope she’s
right. And thank you for taking Miss
Bond’s part. We don’t want our silly ghosts
to hurt any one’s feelings or make any girl
sorry she came to Morton Hall.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeline</span> worked on her play with the
furious industry of the “digs” she had always
ridiculed. The floor of her room was littered
with dusty sheets of manuscript, which she
mysteriously informed her landlady must not
be touched, or “the world and all would be lost.”
She took long, solitary walks, sat for hours at
her desk or the Tally-ho’s, alternately staring
hopelessly into space, or frantically covering
reams of papers with her pretty illegible writing.
Occasionally she emerged from her
closely-guarded solitude and gave a tea-drinking
for the B. C. A.’s, at which she adroitly
turned the conversation to the strangest
topics; or she bundled some long-suffering
friend off with her on an endless shopping
tour or trolley ride, during which she listened
in complete absorption to chance bits of dialogue,
coming home with a delicious new
monologue for which she insisted on an immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
audience, “to test the note of reality,”
she explained vaguely.</p>

<p>One day just before Christmas she was
caught by Mary Brooks in a mellow mood
and dragged off to dinner, to give Dr. Hinsdale
a practical demonstration of some of the
idiosyncrasies of genius. And after Dr. Hinsdale
had gone to his study, over the second
round of coffee by the open fire, she explained
her newest literary device to the bewildered
Mary.</p>

<p>“When I do stunty pageants for my friends
to act and footless little playlets that don’t matter,”
she began, “I just dash them off without
thinking and they turn out beautifully.
But somehow the idea of writing seriously for
publication stiffens me all up inside and muddles
my ideas. Heroine always turns into a
freak or a prig on my hands. Hero gets hysterical
when I try to make him earnest. But
now when things begin to go wrong, I calmly
tear up what I’ve written, and go out and
make my little pals talk off the next scene to
me, or at least recall to my mind how real
conversation sounds. The awfully romantic,
lover-y parts I either have to overhear or extract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
from people who don’t know me. The
girl at Cannon’s who is the model for my
heartless coquette little guesses her proud
mission in life.”</p>

<p>“I should call that just cold-blooded cribbing,”
declared Mary indignantly.</p>

<p>“Cold-blooded cribbing from life is the
very top notch of art,” Madeline assured her.
“My play is a slice from life. I suppose it’s
because I’m young and inexperienced that I
have to keep stopping to refer to life so often
as I go along.”</p>

<p>“Am I in it anywhere?” demanded Mary
eagerly.</p>

<p>“You and the girl at Cannon’s and Fluffy
Dutton and Betty are the principal ingredients
in the heroine,” explained Madeline.
“But I defy you to have discovered it for yourself,
and I swear you to eternal secrecy, because
people would misunderstand. Life with
a big ‘L’ is the kind I’m cribbing; I should
scorn, of course, to put my friends and their
petty affairs into a play.”</p>

<p>Mary drew her smooth brows into a puzzled
frown. “I suppose I shall understand all
that when I see the play,” she said with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>sigh. “George Garrison Hinsdale would
better be saving up for a trip to New York
before long, including a box party to the first
night of your slice from life.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait till the second night
if you want a box,” Madeline told her calmly.
“All the boxes are spoken for on the first
night, and there will be several parties in the
seats, besides.”</p>

<p>This calm assumption of success made Mary
gasp and engage her husband, later in the evening,
in an intricate discussion of the distinction
between the serene self-assurance of genius and
the ordinary man’s unjustified conceit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eleanor Watson wanted to join Jim in New
York. He was sure of being there for several
months, he wrote her, and equally sure of being
sent off to “some miserable hole” in the
early spring.</p>

<p>“Beating the firm’s time-limit on Morton
Hall,” he wrote, “is about the unluckiest
thing I ever did. They’ve written me down
for a hustler, and slated me for all the forlorn
hopes. Remind Betty that she owes me a
good long letter for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>The thing that kept Eleanor at Harding
was of course the devotion of the Terrible
Ten to her and to education under her auspices.
In vain she had introduced other
story-tellers; the evenings that she stayed
away to give Mr. Thayer’s most promising
candidates a trial were tumultuous revolts,
or, after she had patiently explained to the
class how unhappy their disorderly conduct
made her, spiritless sessions, endured because
the smouldering fire in Rafael’s eyes commanded
outward submission from the Ten.</p>

<p>“But if you really leave I’m afraid they’ll
all backslide again,” said Mr. Thayer, “and
you see they’re on probation now to the very
end of their course. Did Rafael tell you that
he’d had another raise? That boy does the
work of two men, in spite of his bad hand&mdash;runs
the most difficult machine in the factory,
and makes repairs that we used to have to
get a man up from Boston to attend to.”</p>

<p>“How old is he?” asked Eleanor idly.</p>

<p>“Eighteen, he thinks. They’re all older
than they look or act.”</p>

<p>Eleanor sighed. “They won’t be able to
meet the reading requirements of the factory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>law for six weeks yet, and they ought to be
induced to keep on all winter&mdash;certainly the
ones who are bright enough at their work to
have any future before them. But it does
seem absurd for me to stay on here just because
ten young Italians listen to my stories
and eat my peanuts.”</p>

<p>“And appreciate the tact and understanding
that you bestow so generously, mixed
with the peanuts and the stories,” added Mr.
Thayer soberly.</p>

<p>That night Eleanor went to Mr. Thayer’s
office after the class to have one more consultation
with him about its future. When
she came back for her coat and hat a stealthy
figure slipped past her in the hall.</p>

<p>“Did you forget something, Rafael?” she
asked, recognizing her favorite pupil.</p>

<p>Rafael muttered something unintelligible
and hurried off, but his return was explained
when Eleanor found a neatly folded note
tucked in the sleeve of her coat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Der Mis”&mdash;it began, “I luv yu. i haf
nuther raz. I keep you good lik lada. Wil
yu haf me to mary, if not I die</p>

<p class="right">“Yur <span class="smcap">Rafael</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“I tak 1 hor a day for wik to make thiz
note rite.”</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eleanor read the pathetic little missive
through with growing dismay. He had misunderstood
her kindness&mdash;the pictures she had
given him to brighten the dark little hovel
where he and his family lived, the Thanksgiving
dinner she had sent them, the special
smile she always had ready when he appeared
at the club. She started to show
her note to Mr. Thayer, then changed her
mind.</p>

<p>After all, Rafael was in earnest, and she
would treat his proposal like any other. It
should be a secret between them. She would
think out for herself some kindly way of explaining
that she could not “haf” him “to
mary,” and that he must not die of a broken
heart.</p>

<p>The next evening when the class met she
smiled at him just as usual, and catching his
eye early in the evening slipped a note, folded
as his had been, under his cap.</p>

<p>In it she had printed, in short easy words
that Rafael could read, how sorry she was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>disappoint him, how she liked him for a
friend, how he must forget what he had
written and work hard to make the Italian
girl whom he would love some day proud and
happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>“I can’t treat it as absurd,” she had decided,
“and I can’t be cross to him. He
means it all, and he doesn’t dream how comical
it is. I only hope he won’t be too excited
to read what I’ve written.”</p>

<p>Evidently he was not, for just as Eleanor,
having said good-night to the Harding girls
who had walked up the hill with her from
their classes, was turning in at her own door,
Rafael glided out from the shadow of the
house and stood in her path.</p>

<p>“Der is no hope?” he demanded tragically,
standing bareheaded before her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rafael,” Eleanor remonstrated, “I
always speak the truth to you, don’t I? I
wrote you a note because you wrote me one;
and now you ask me if I mean it. Why,
dear boy, I’m almost old enough to be your
mother.”</p>

<p>“I love you,” Rafael told her stoutly.</p>

<p>“Then please me by acting sensible. You’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>much too young to think about marrying and
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You luf anodder,” broke in Rafael accusingly.</p>

<p>Eleanor flushed pink under cover of the
darkness. Hardly to herself even did she
admit the part that Richard Blake played in
her thoughts. Indeed so skilfully had she
concealed it that Dick Blake, working day and
night to push “The Quiver” to the top of the
magazine world, was wont to smile scornfully
to himself when he thought how little he and
his valiant efforts meant to the girl who, in
all his hopes and plans and dreams, was to
share his future.</p>

<p>But in a swift moment’s consideration
Eleanor decided that the best way to cure this
sentimental little Italian boy of his infatuation
was to let him know that he had indeed
a successful rival. Telling Rafael was different
from admitting it to anyone else&mdash;because
Rafael was foolishly in love too.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand impulsively and
patted his shoulder. “Yes, Rafael,” she
whispered softly, “I’m in love with somebody
else. But he doesn’t know it yet, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>I’m not sure that he cares for me. Nobody
knows it but you, and I’m telling you because
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, lovely lada, good-bye.” Rafael
caught the hand that lay on his shoulder,
kissed it in his passionate, foreign fashion,
and glided away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Eleanor stood looking after him with the
curious sensation of being the heroine of a
pretty old-time romance that belonged in a
fairy world of magic and moonlight, and
ought to be set to the tinkling music of
guitars. And just as she had put out her
light and gone to bed, still smiling at the
whimsicality of the whole affair, and particularly
of her having confided to Rafael her
carefully-secreted feeling for Dick&mdash;who would
do beautifully for the brave young prince of
the fairy-tale the music came. The Terrible
Ten were grouped under the window singing
soft, crooning Italian songs to their Lovely
Lada. Giuseppi had traveled with his father
one summer in a troupe of street musicians;
it was his fingers that picked a bit uncertainly
at the guitar’s strings, and little Nicolo’s wonderful
voice, rising sweet and true above the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>others, that led the chorus. But Rafael stood
in the centre of the half circle, his angelic
face touched with light from a down-stairs
window, and the sob and the thrill in the
music, that brought a lump to Eleanor’s
throat and a mist over her eyes, was all in
Rafael’s voice, singing out his love and longing
to the cruel lady who would not “haf”
him “to mary.”</p>

<p>Eleanor had a bunch of red roses on her
table that the adoring Eugenia Ford had sent
her, and she tossed them down to the singers,
who laughed and cheered in most unromantic
boy fashion, and finally departed, leaving
Eleanor to wonder how Rafael had explained
the serenade to his followers, and how he
would treat her at the next club meeting.
She little guessed what would happen before
then.</p>

<p>For the next morning before she was dressed
an apologetic parlor-maid escorted a weeping
Italian girl to Eleanor’s door. It was Pietro’s
flashing-eyed sister, her beauty tear-stained
and her proud confidence quite vanished.</p>

<p>“Rafael’s hurt,” she sobbed. “Black Hand
maybe, we think. He don’t know nothing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>but he moan your name with his eyes shut.
Would you come?”</p>

<p>Of course she would come. She hurried
the maid off after the best doctor in Harding,
and she and the beautiful Maria went at once
to Rafael, who lay tossing in delirium on his
blood-stained bed, a terrible gash across his
throat, which had been roughly bandaged by
an old Italian herb doctor. Nobody, it
seemed, guessed what had really happened,
though when some one found a tiny dagger
under the bed Pietro and Nicolo interchanged
curious glances. They had recognized it as
the one with which Rafael had struck terror
to the hearts of the Ten and compelled their
rigid obedience.</p>

<p>Eleanor installed a trained nurse, made the
doctor promise to give the case his best attention,
and went off to find her unfailing stand-by
in troublous times, Betty Wales. For
Rafael was beyond knowing anybody, perhaps
for all time, and she felt like a criminal
when his mother kissed her sleeve in gratitude
for all she had done and Maria clung to
her, sobbing out her love for Rafael who
never had “eyes for any girl” and declaring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>that if he died she would enter a convent.
She couldn’t bring herself to tell them the
dreadful truth.</p>

<p>But, “If he dies I shall be a murderer,”
she told Betty bitterly. “I’ve always been so
vain and frivolous. Now when I want to
take life seriously and do things for other
people, as you do, I only make a mess of it,
and bring dreadful trouble where I wanted
most to help. I shall never, never try to do
anything more. I wish I were&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” Betty assured her hastily.
“Just because you did the best you could for
those boys and this silly one had his head
full of sentimental nonsense doesn’t make you
responsible. It’s a dreadful thing, of course,
but I’m sure he’ll get well. Didn’t the doctor
think so?”</p>

<p>The doctor hadn’t said.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll leave word for him to telephone
you here of any change either way,” Betty
decreed. “Mrs. Post is going to make German
Christmas cakes this morning for the
girls. She wanted me to help her, but I’ve
got to go to the Tally-ho before chapel and
then to the office, so you simply must help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>instead. I suppose you haven’t had any
breakfast, have you now?”</p>

<p>Eleanor didn’t want any.</p>

<p>“Of course you do. I’ll send some up by a
maid, and Mrs. Post will tell you when she’s
ready to begin on the cakes. Remember, the
telephone messages will come here, so you
must stay till I get back.”</p>

<p>Six times that morning Betty left an accommodating
friend in charge of her office, and
in the short intervals between clients rushed
over to inquire for the cakes, Eleanor, and
Rafael. At noon she snatched a moment before
luncheon to tell Mr. Thayer all about
it&mdash;Eleanor had declared she never could do
that&mdash;so that he could explain what was
necessary to the authorities and avoid a futile
search for non-existent Black Hand plots and
family feuds. Mr. Thayer had seen Rafael
and the doctor, and the doctor had been very
encouraging. Betty flew back to assure
Eleanor that he had not been deceiving her&mdash;that
he had said the very same things to Mr.
Thayer&mdash;and to beg her assistance that afternoon
at the Tally-ho workshop. For Madeline
had come out of her dramatic eclipse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>long enough to design some Christmas dinner-cards,
and there was a small fortune in
them if only they could be put on sale in
time. Secretly Eleanor thought that Betty
had grown just a little bit selfish and very
commercial since they had left college; but
she could not well refuse, after the dainty
breakfast on a tray and all the calls and the
arranging with Mr. Thayer, to help with the
Christmas dinner-cards.</p>

<p>Next day Rafael was worse. The doctor
looked serious and suggested a night-nurse
and a consultation. At noon Eleanor declared
that the air of the little workshop
stifled her, and Betty gave up office-hours&mdash;an
unheard-of proceeding&mdash;to go for a long
tramp, during which she planned all sorts of
delightful things that Eleanor should do for
Rafael when he got well.</p>

<p>The next day the boy was better, the day
after that worse. But at the end of a nerve-racking
week of alternating hopes and fears
the doctor pronounced him out of danger.
That very afternoon Jim telegraphed that he
was sick with a cold and needed Eleanor.
Jim had always hated coddling, Eleanor commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
wonderingly, and failed to notice
Betty’s dimple flashing out in a tiny smile
that was at once sternly suppressed. For Jim
had written her that he only hoped he could
preserve “the faded shadow of a suspicion of
a snuffle” until Eleanor’s arrival. “After
that,” he concluded, “I count on my new
bull pup, suitors galore, and the diversions of
little old New York to blow away any remaining
relics of melancholy. When the
poor little chap is well enough dad and I will
see him through the best trade-school we can
find and give him every chance that’s coming
to him. Adoring some girls is a thing no fellow
can or ought to help.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">GENIUS ARRIVES</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> was going home for Christmas&mdash;a
“ploshkin” income puts life on such
a comfortable financial basis! And between
Christmas and New Year’s Babe was going to
be married. That meant coming half-way
back to Harding for the wedding; and it
made easier Betty’s sad decision that since the
stocking factory was willing to postpone its
Christmas party till New Year’s, and since
most of the Morton Hall girls would spend
their vacations in town, and certainly be very
forlorn indeed unless somebody looked after
them, it was the duty of Miss B. Wales, Secretary,
to come back early and lend a hand.</p>

<p>Betty breathed a deep sigh of relief when
she had seen Eleanor off to New York, in the
company of Madeline Ayres, who had finished
her play and now flatly refused to delay the
putting on of the final touches in New York
for the interests of the Tally-ho’s gift-shop department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Why, my dear girls,” she declared tragically,
“I’m not half through yet. I’ve got
to see every success on Broadway now, to get
into touch with the season’s fads. Then I
shall ‘supe’ a few times, to catch the right
feeling for one or two bare spots in my first
act. Finally, I shall probably hate my play
so that I’ll tear it up and take the next boat
for Naples, to be consoled by my Bohemian
family, who will laud me to the skies for
tearing up a play because I considered it bad
art.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Madeline!” came in horror-struck
chorus at this point.</p>

<p>“Well,” Madeline admitted blandly, “I’m
willing to confide to friends that at present
my humble effort looks to me like the play
of the year&mdash;and I’m fairly stage-wise already.
Dick Blake used to advise all the aspiring
dramatic critics he knew to take me along to
their big first nights, because I can always tell
by instinct what the audience is saying to itself.
I’m a perfect mirror of public opinion.
If I still believe in my play after I’ve been
’round a little I shall see Miss Dwight and
her manager. After that&mdash;&mdash;” Madeline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>shrugged her shoulders, and confided irrelevantly
to the resident B. C. A.’s, who had
come down to see the travelers off, that she
wanted a black velvet hat with a white
feather.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to have it, what’s more,”
she ended. “I wrote dad, and he just said,
‘It’s lucky you don’t want two white feathers,
now isn’t it?’ And he sent along a munificent
check.”</p>

<p>Which proved, Betty said, that genius is
not incompatible with frivolous-mindedness.</p>

<p>Jim sniffled manfully on their arrival, and
his carefully marshaled “features” diverted
Eleanor beautifully, especially after she had
been up to Harding once to see Rafael, who,
after he began to mend, progressed with
amazing rapidity on the road to recovery.
Because she had dreaded seeing him, she was
relieved to get the meeting over, and much
more relieved to find the boy so completely
changed. As soon as it could be managed he
had been moved to a hospital, and the new
atmosphere, supplemented by good care and
kindness, had done wonders for him. Before
he was well enough to leave, Mr. Thayer declared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Rafael would be completely Americanized.</p>

<p>He greeted Eleanor with a frank smile
above his big bandages.</p>

<p>“I awful silly boy,” he said, holding out a
thin hand to her. “I guess you want laugh
at me. I guess you tink I know not how
gran’ you live in this country. Now I know.
I know two, tree nurse-lady and many visitor-lady,
looka like you. I like to live here always.
I hope I get well awful slow.”</p>

<p>But, when Eleanor had delivered Jim’s
message about Rafael’s going, as soon as he
was strong enough, to a fine trade-school in
Philadelphia, he changed his mind.</p>

<p>“Den I hope I get well awful fast. Before
I get old, I know how all de wheels in dis
world go round, mebbe. I think you be mad
at me, and now you do me dis great big
splendor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I wasn’t ever ‘mad’ at you,”
Eleanor explained, “only sorry you were so
silly, and dreadfully frightened when you
were so ill the first week.”</p>

<p>Rafael shrugged his shoulders. “Good
ting for me. I come here. I learn how to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>be ’Merican man in two, tree weeks. I
come here silly lil foreign boy. I look
roun’. I listen hard. I see how you do
here in your gran’ country. And now,” Rafael
snuggled into his pillows with a beatific
smile, “I find why all dose wheel go roun’.
I maka fine machine, mebbe. I swear off
carry a dagger. And I tank you alla my life.”</p>

<p>So Eleanor could return to Jim, the bull
pup, the suitors, and the diversions of New
York, with the happy assurance that in the
end Rafael’s devotion to her might be the
making of him, and at the least its untoward
climax would do him more good than harm.
Having nothing now to worry about, she devoted
the journey back to New York to planning
a ravishing new gown for Babe’s wedding.
It was to be yellow, because Dick
Blake (who would not be at the wedding)
liked yellow gowns on her best; and very
plain, because Dick liked simple lines and
no furbelows. Details might safely be left to
Madame Celeste. It would perhaps be more
accurate to say that Eleanor devoted the
journey back to New York to thinking about
Dick Blake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>Babe’s wedding was to be a grand society
function.</p>

<p>“To please John’s father and my mother,”
Babe wrote to her friends of 19&mdash;; “John
and I are resigned, because a wedding only
lasts for one evening, and after that we can
shut ourselves up in our regular castle of a
house, with only the people we want, and
everything you can think of in your wildest
dreams to amuse ourselves with. So one little
evening isn’t much to sacrifice. Mother
says we owe it to our social position. She
doesn’t know that we have decided not to
have any social position. We’re just going
to have a good time and try to make some
good times for other people. An impromptu
wedding would have been lots more fun, but
you must all come, just the same.”</p>

<p>Babe’s sister was to be maid of honor, Bob
and Babbie, Betty and Roberta Lewis were
to be bridesmaids, and the other “Merry
Hearts” would sit together in a front pew,
and be considered just as much in the wedding
party as if they were bridesmaids also.
Jasper J. Morton was coming up the night of
the wedding in his private car. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>meant to come the day before “to help you
entertain Miss B. A. and her friends,” he
wrote Babe, but there were important directors’
meetings to keep him at the last
minute. He wrote Babe not to worry about
him. “I shall charter a special train if necessary&mdash;and
don’t I always arrive on time as
a matter of principle?”</p>

<p>But when Babe left the house for the
church he had not appeared, and after they
had kept people waiting and wondering half
an hour, and Babe was so nervous that she
declared she should cry in one more minute
it was decided to go on without him.</p>

<p>The reception was half over when he appeared,
looking very meek and sheepish. He
kissed Babe on both cheeks, shook John’s
hand till it ached, and despatched Babbie to
“find those reporter fellows and tell ’em I’m
not smashed up anywhere between here and
New York, and I don’t withhold my blessing
from the happy couple. Tell ’em I was accidentally
detained, and if they want to know
how say it was on a private matter that is
none of their business.”</p>

<p>“And add some characteristic remarks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>about the ridiculous apes who try to run our
railroads,” put in John with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Jasper J. Morton, with emphasis,
“not this trip. Pretty nearly every
mile was a record, and I’ve recommended that
engineer to run the road’s Lightning Limited
at a big increase over his present pay. The
reason I didn’t get here was personal&mdash;purely
personal.”</p>

<p>Later in the evening he got Babe and John
and Betty into a corner, and told them all
about it. “Miss B. A.’s to blame, as usual,”
he began. “You see my train went out just
ten minutes behind the Lightning Limited,
with no stop till Albany and the track
clear all the way west. I was hurrying
through the station to get on, when I nearly
ran down a pretty little woman who was crying
so hard she didn’t see me coming. She’d
lost the Lightning Limited, and her husband
was dying in a little place just beyond Albany
where he’d gone on business and been
taken suddenly sick. There was a slow train
in an hour, but that would be too late, she said.</p>

<p>“Naturally I told her to come with me to
Albany. And then of course I couldn’t leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>her there to hunt up her connection alone,
and have to waste time waiting, maybe. So
I arranged for a stop at the town she was
going to, and then,” Jasper J. Morton flushed
shamefacedly, “when nobody met her, we
side-tracked our outfit and I drove up to the
hotel with her. She was barely in time, the
doctor said. They’d been married just a year
to-day, she told me. I guess if ever you two
are in a tight place you’ll be thankful to anybody
who misses his boy’s wedding to help
you out. But I wouldn’t have those reporters
out there know what a soft-hearted old auntie
I’m getting to be, not for anything. Miss B.
A., you’ll be the ruin of me yet, with all your
theories about looking out for the other
fellow.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be married all over again if you’d
like us to, Father Morton,” Babe offered
gallantly, although she had assured John after
the ceremony that she wouldn’t ever have
promised to marry him if she bad realized
the queer feelings you have while you are
doing it.</p>

<p>But Mr. Morton refused her generous offer.
“I’m satisfied,” he said, “as long as John’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>got you for a wife and I’ve got you for a
daughter. My seeing it done wouldn’t have
made any big difference to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it would,” broke in Babe kindly.</p>

<p>“Not the difference it made to that poor
little crying lady to see her husband,” pursued
Mr. Morton. Then he chuckled merrily
as Babbie appeared, looking very angry and
quite absurdly pretty in consequence. “Were
those reporters inquisitive?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“They did think you stayed away on purpose,”
declared Babbie indignantly. “As if
any one could possibly disapprove of Babe! I
told them you were just as fond of her as
John is. And now they’re discussing what
effect your being late will have on Wall
Street. They said to tell you that, and to
ask you please to come out and talk to them,
if you didn’t want the market to collapse to-morrow
like a pricked balloon. They laughed
right in my face when I said it was a ‘private
affair’ that kept you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll settle them,” said Jasper J. Morton,
and went off muttering something about
“those chimpanzees that run the newspapers.”</p>

<p>Whereat John looked relieved. “First time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>he’s acted natural to-night,” he said. “If he
hadn’t gone up in the air pretty soon, I
should have telegraphed his doctor. But
now we can start on our wedding trip feeling
perfectly safe about him.”</p>

<p>Madeline couldn’t come to the wedding.
She had sent her play to Miss Dwight’s manager,
and now she was exerting all her ingenuity
to get a personal interview with Miss
Dwight herself.</p>

<p>“Her present play isn’t going well, and
she’s as cross as a bear,” Madeline wrote Babe.
“Dick Blake knows her&mdash;had dinner with
her just before I came down. She said that
night that she believed in her play, and if it
failed she should lose all faith in American
audiences, buy a lake in Maine and a river in
Florida, and retire from the stage. Dick says
she will never do that, but he thinks it’s no
use talking my play to her in her present
mood. He got the manager of the Lyric Repertoire
Theatre to say he’d read the manuscript,
and now he’s perfectly furious with me
because I persist with Miss Dwight. ‘Agatha
or nobody’ is my war-cry! If she’d only
read my play or talk to me, one or the other,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>I know there wouldn’t be any more trouble.
That play fits her like a glove, and it will
take&mdash;oh, how it will take!”</p>

<p>When college opened again Madeline was
still on Miss Dwight’s trail, but almost ready
to give up and let the Lyric manager, or anybody
else who wanted it, take her play. Miss
Dwight’s manager had made no sign. Miss
Dwight herself, piqued by her first failure,
had entrenched herself behind unassailable
barriers.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried everything,” wrote Madeline
despairingly. “I got ‘The Sentinel’ to send
me to interview her, and she wouldn’t let me
in. The Enderbys gave a dinner for her;
she accepted and then sent word she was ill.
Dick Blake relented and tried to introduce
the subject of his talented young friend, and
she would hear none of me.</p>

<p class="p2b">“To-night I’m playing my last card. If it
doesn’t take the trick, why, I’ve lost, that’s
all. Rumor says that her manager has had
six hundred plays sent him this last week&mdash;of
course he won’t find mine under that pile.”</p>

<p class="caption">JUST AS THEY HAD GIVEN HER UP</p>

<p class="p2">For two weeks thereafter the pen of the aspiring
playwright was silent. Betty and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>Mary Brooks decided that she was busy getting
her play out from under the pile of other
manuscripts, in order to send it to the despised
manager of the Lyric. So they were
surprised and delighted when Betty received a
rapturous, incoherent scrawl, announcing
complete success.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She took it. She’s rehearsing it now.
The part does fit her, just as I said it would.
She’s coming up with me soon to see Harding.</p>

<p>“With love from the happiest girl in New
York,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mad.</span></p>

<p>“P. S.&mdash;Plan a B. C. A. tea-party for to-morrow.
I can’t wait any longer to tell you
all about it.”</p></div>

<p>The B. C. A.’s assembled joyously, and just
as they had given her up Madeline appeared,
trying hard to act offhand and unconcerned,
and managing it about as badly as might have
been expected of a young person whose first
play was being rehearsed with much enthusiasm
by Agatha Dwight, and advertised far
and wide by her manager as the play of the
year.</p>

<p>The B. C. A.’s plied her with tea, muffins,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>and jam, which she despatched promptly, and
with questions, which she totally ignored,
giving them all sorts of irrelevant information
about Eleanor’s music, Jim’s dog, and Dick’s
splendid serial, by a “dark horse” in fiction-writing,
which was doing wonders for the
subscription list and the standing of “The
Quiver.” When she had finished three cups
of tea and uncounted muffins, she settled back
in a corner of the Tally-ho stall with a sigh of
complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “I’ll tell you all about it.
It’s much too good a story to mix up with
crumpets and tea, like ordinary conversation.
And don’t interrupt, or I shall be sorry I
came.”</p>

<p>Awestruck silence met this dire announcement,
and Madeline began.</p>

<p>“I wrote you about the interview I couldn’t
get, the dinner Miss Dwight wouldn’t come
to, the time she snapped Dick off so short,
and all that. There were other things of the
same kind&mdash;a reception the Woman’s College
Club gave for her, when she swept in looking
like a princess, made a funny, fascinating
little speech, and swept out again. Well, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>was to have introduced her to people that afternoon,
and I’d counted on making her notice
me and so getting my chance. I didn’t
get it that way, but I made a discovery.</p>

<p>“I found that a girl who had a walking part
in the first act of her play and another in the
last, and who was down on the bills as Annette
Weeks for one and Felicia Trench for
the other, was a Harding girl named plain
Mary Smith. That is, she didn’t graduate,
but was here a year or two just before our
time. Well, I went to that ridiculous play
every night for a week, until I knew every
bit of the Weeks-Trench business as well as
Mary Smith herself. Then I waited for her
at the stage door after a matinée, took her
for tea somewhere, told her what I wanted,
and begged her to play sick and let me do her
part for a week or two.</p>

<p>“At first she laughed at me&mdash;said she might
play sick all she could, but I wouldn’t get the
place. Besides, I was taller than she. What
would I do for clothes? Before I could get
the dresses made the play would be done for.
For a minute I was stumped by that&mdash;I hadn’t
thought of clothes. Then I remembered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>Eleanor’s super-elegant wardrobe, and I knew
she’d lend me some things under the circumstances.
And I saw that Mary Smith was in
the same mood as Miss Dwight,&mdash;discouraged
over the play and worried at being left in
mid-season without a part. So I talked hard,
all about my play and the honor of Harding,
and the college girl’s elevating the stage by
writing as well as by acting. And then I put
it to her: ‘You’ve got nothing much to lose,
and I’ve got everything to gain. Can you
act?’ She shook her head. ‘Miss Dwight
took me on because she wants to encourage
nice girls to go on the stage. There’s a walking
part in nearly every play, so she’s kept me.’
‘There’s a walking part in my play,’ I told her,
‘and if this one isn’t good for over two weeks
you can rest and go to the theatre and save
your dresses for another part.’ ‘All right,’ she
said. ‘Of course you get the salary,’ I said.
‘Give me a pencil,’ she said, ‘and I’ll write
you the reference.’ That’s how I landed in
Agatha Dwight’s company, exactly two weeks
ago to-night.”</p>

<p>Madeline paused dramatically. Mary
Brooks opened her mouth to ask a question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
and closed it again hastily, gasping
like a fish. Helen Chase Adams got as far as
the initial “burble” of “but,” and stopped
spasmodically. Madeline had impressed
them all with the importance of obeying
the rules of the occasion.</p>

<p>“That,” she said, looking around the circle
with a pleased smile, “is chapter one. The
next thing was to get Her Highness to notice
me. The first night, as she swept by me on
her way to her car, she inquired for the girl
I’d ousted, and said it was refreshing to find
an understudy who didn’t need breaking in.
After that she never looked at me for four
days except in the scenes, and then with a
vacant sort of a stare and a stage smile. But
the next night she turned giddy in the first
act, and I managed to improvise a parlor
story that fitted well enough into the scene
while she snuffed smelling-salts and pulled
herself together, so that the audience never
guessed that anything was wrong. She
looked awfully angry&mdash;at herself or me, I
couldn’t tell which. But the manager patted
me on the back, and perhaps because he told
her to she sent for me to come to her in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>long intermission. And I went, of course,
and she asked me all about myself, and she
liked my answers. So I plunged right in.
The manager spent the night finding my play
for her, and she spent the morning reading it
and the afternoon talking to me about it, and
the next day they began rehearsals&mdash;with
the walking lady back in her part. I explained
about her, and Miss Dwight thought
it was a lovely story. She’s got a real Harding
sense of humor; and she’s coming up
here before long to see the place. That’s all.”
Madeline leaned forward to reach for the
muffin plate, and perceiving it to be empty
hastily leaned back again.</p>

<p>Mary summoned Nora. “More muffins,
please,” she ordered, “and don’t look so reproachful,
Nora, please, over our appetites.
Miss Madeline has been too busy lately proving
that she’s a genius to take time to eat.
Now she’s making up for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and is that what’s to pay?” said
Nora, smiling comprehensively at the B. C.
A.’s. “Provin’ anything is hard worrk. I
could never prove me sums at school. That’s
because they was generally wrong. It’s awful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>hard to prove what ain’t so, ain’t it now,
Miss Madeline?” And Nora departed amiably
for more muffins, ignoring the bursts of
laughter that followed her. Nora had long
since ceased to attach any significance to the
laughter of the Harding girls. They laughed
just as other people breathed. It was as unaccountable
as the enormous number of muffins
they consumed.</p>

<p>They were still laughing when Nora came
back with Mary’s order. They sent her off
again for hot tea, and they drank Madeline’s
health in it, and Miss Dwight’s, and the
health of the Walking Lady who had helped
Madeline to play out her trump card. They
congratulated Madeline riotously, they made
wonderful plans for Miss Dwight’s visit to
Harding, and others for seeing the first night
of the play.</p>

<p>“We are at last justified in the eyes of the
wide, wide world,” declaimed Mary pompously.
“We’ve been called the cleverest
crowd in college, and now we’ve shown ’em.
A well-kept husband like mine and a well-kept
tea-room like Betty’s are nice little features,
but a play for Agatha Dwight is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>real thing. And the moral of that is: Look
out for a genius, and the grand-stand play
will look out for itself.”</p>

<p>“And the moral of that,” said little Helen
Chase Adams primly, “is that it’s time for
faculty wives to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Also campus faculty,” added Rachel
hastily, and the most exciting B. C. A. tea-drinking
of the season reluctantly dispersed.</p>

<span class="smaller">AS A BULL PUP ORDAINS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Harding College</span> was almost as excited
over Madeline’s play as the B. C. A.’s had
been.</p>

<p>“Why, she wrote it in this very town,”
wide-eyed freshmen told each other.</p>

<p>“In this very room, maybe,” diners at the
Tally-ho added wonderingly.</p>

<p>“And she’s only been out of college a year
and a half.”</p>

<p>“I guess our little Catherine will be heard
from some day. Miss Ayres was the leading
literary light of her class, just like Cath. I
can tell you these college reputations mean
something!”</p>

<p>“Did you hear how she got Miss Dwight to
read her play?”</p>

<p>“What’s it about, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows&mdash;it’s a dead secret. But
college girls come into it, I guess, because
Miss Dwight is going to visit Miss Ayres up
here&mdash;to study the atmosphere, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going in for elocution this next semester.
If I get a good part in the senior play,
I shall seriously consider going on the stage.
Miss Dwight encourages college girls to do that.
She thinks it offers a splendid field for educated
women.”</p>

<p>So was Harding College once more stage-struck,
and Miss Dick’s school as well. The
Smallest Sister carried the great news there,
and Frisky Fenton and her crowd bought Miss
Dwight’s pictures to adorn their dressers, and
bribed the Smallest Sister, by the subtlest arts
known to the big girl for beguiling the little
one, to arrange a dinner-party for them at the
Tally-ho on the night when Miss Dwight was
to be there.</p>

<p>“You promised me a spread down there
long ago,” the Smallest Sister urged Betty.</p>

<p>“But I shall be so very busy that night,”
Betty objected. “Couldn’t you come by
yourself then, and have the party later?”</p>

<p>“But the others want to see her just as
much as I do,” Dorothy urged. “Frisky
said she would about die of joy if she could
see her, and so will all of them. And they’ve
been awfully nice to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Betty resignedly, “only I
can’t sit with you and you’ll probably have a
very poor dinner, because the tea-shop will be
so crowded.”</p>

<p>After all, one table more or less wouldn’t
matter, she reflected, on a night when practically
every Harding girl would try to get her
dinner at the Tally-ho.</p>

<p>Miss Dwight off the stage was a demure
little lady with wonderful eyes, a smile that
made people who saw it smile back in spite of
themselves, and a voice that thrilled one no
matter what its owner said. Her hair was
gray, and so were her clothes, when they
weren’t black. She hated attention, shrank
forlornly behind Madeline when the girls
stared or sang to her, and only came to dinner
at the Tally-ho because Madeline had assured
her that it was, at the dinner-hour, the very
soul and centre of the college world.</p>

<p>Having come, she exclaimed rapturously at
all the “features,” and then, perceiving that
she was the chief of them, she hid in the remotest
corner of Jack o’ Hearts’ stall, with
Madeline on one side for protection and Mary
and Betty to talk to across the way. Her big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>hat drooped so far over her face that girls
who rudely looked in as they went by the
stall saw nothing but the soft curve of her
cheek and her chin cleft by a big dimple&mdash;unless
it happened to be a moment when she had
boldly resolved to look out upon these “wonderful,
frightful collegians.” Then she lifted
the brim of the absurd hat with a fascinating
gesture, and smiled her clear, childlike smile
at the curious passers-by.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s table was the one nearest to Jack
o’ Hearts’ stall, so that she and her friends
came in for a generous share of Miss Dwight’s
smiling inspection of her surroundings. But
that wasn’t enough for Frisky Fenton.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to speak to her,” she declared.
“If she’s as retiring as you say, Dot,
I’m afraid we shan’t get any chance later. I
think I’ll go over there now.”</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid Betty wouldn’t like it,”
objected the Smallest Sister anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, if she doesn’t, she won’t blame you,”
retorted Frisky, “and I shan’t mind being in
hot water with her, as long as I get a chance
to talk to Miss Dwight. I can make it all
right with your sister afterward, I’m sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Please don’t go, Frisky,” begged Dorothy,
sending imploring glances across at Betty,
who was perfectly oblivious of the Smallest
Sister’s efforts. “It’s not polite to go where
you’re not invited. Betty said she’d have us
meet Miss Dwight later if she could.”</p>

<p>Frisky gave an irritating little laugh.
“You don’t understand about such things,
dear. I’m not a child, to be sent for with dessert.”
And with that she jumped up and
crossed quickly to Jack o’ Hearts’ stall, where
she appeared, a very pretty, demure, totally
inexplicable vision, before the astonished
party of diners. She nodded to Betty and
Madeline, smiled at Mary, and curtseyed, with
dropped eyes, before Miss Dwight.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Dwight,” she said
sweetly, “but do you think I’d be a success
on the stage? I’m crazy about it.”</p>

<p>Miss Dwight laughed heartily at the absurd
question. “Sit down, my dear,” she said, not
seeming to mind the unwarranted invasion of
her privacy. “Are you one of these astonishing
Harding girls?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m only at school,” explained Frisky
calmly, “but I’m as old as some college girls.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>And anyway, isn’t it better to begin acting
when you’re very young?”</p>

<p>Miss Dwight stared at her, a sombre shadow
in her great dark eyes. “You’re far too pretty
to begin young,” she said. “Some day, if
you really want it, and your mother is willing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve only a stepmother,” put in Frisky
airily, “so I needn’t consider that.”</p>

<p>Miss Dwight looked at her again. “It’s a
hard life, my dear&mdash;a long pull, and very
little besides more hard work for you if you
win, and if you never do make good&mdash;and
most of us don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t discourage me,” Frisky
broke in impulsively. “It’s the one thing
in life for me.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you have some idea about life
before you say that,” Miss Dwight advised her
rather sharply. “Make friends with your
stepmother, to begin with. If you can do
that now, perhaps some day you can make
friends with an audience. Go back to school
and study hard. Read the great plays and
the great poems. And in five years, if you’re
still stage-struck, come to me&mdash;and I’ll give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>you some more good advice. Good-bye, my
dear.” She held out her hand with a definite
gesture of dismissal that even Frisky could
not ignore.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and thank you,” said the girl,
“but five years is an awfully long time to
wait, Miss Dwight. You may see me sooner.”</p>

<p>With which parting shot, Frisky returned
to her horrified friends more stage-struck
than ever, and more confident of her ability
to manage any situation to her liking. Her
vanity would have received a severe shock if
she had heard Miss Dwight call her a silly
child, Madeline emphasize the fact that Frisky
wasn’t a college girl, or a type of even the
shallowest variety, and Betty confide to Mary
Brooks Hinsdale that she was thoroughly
ashamed of the Smallest Sister’s new chum.</p>

<p>The next morning Frisky sent Miss Dwight
a bunch of violets and a gushing note, which
her divinity refused to read because “the
handwriting made her nervous.” But there
was also a note from Helena Mason, enclosing
a little verse which she asked permission to
print in the next “Argus.” Miss Dwight
laughed and cried over it, declared it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>the best thing that had ever been written
about her, and made Madeline take her at
once to see the author, who gushed, in conversation,
as badly as Frisky had on paper,
and seemed to have the vaguest possible ideas
about Miss Dwight’s genius, which she had
described so aptly in her poetical mood.</p>

<p>“All literary people are bores but you, my
dear,” Miss Dwight declared, hurrying Madeline
away. “I discovered that years ago, but
I’m always forgetting it again. If anybody
else sends me a poem, please remind me to
shun her. Time in Harding is too precious
to be wasted.”</p>

<p>Miss Dwight could stay away from New
York only two days&mdash;“two sweet, stolen
days,” she called them. Then she hurried
back to the rehearsals, leaving Madeline in
Betty’s charge.</p>

<p>“She’s done all that she can for her play
now,” she explained, “and she’d far better
stay here. She might make us nervous, and
she’d certainly make herself miserable. Rehearsals
are such contrary things. They’ve
gone so abominably up to now that I’m absolutely
sure the play will be a hit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The nature of the hit was still a mystery.
Madeline, Miss Dwight, and her manager
were all stubbornly dumb. The title wasn’t
even put on the bill-boards until a week
before the opening night, and then it might
mean anything&mdash;“Her Choice.”</p>

<p>Nearly all the B. C. A.’s were going down
to see the first performance, but the one who
was most excited at the prospect, next to
Madeline, was undoubtedly Eleanor Watson.
Her gowns had figured in Madeline’s “walking
part,” but that wasn’t the chief reason for
her interest in the play. The great thing was
that Richard Blake was giving a box party
and a supper, and he had asked her and Jim
to come. Dick had almost never taken her
anywhere, and this winter he had been too
busy even to come often to call. Yet Madeline
seemed to see a good deal of him.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t care for me. Why should
he?” Eleanor had reflected sadly. “He likes
Madeline because she’s clever about the same
sort of things that he is interested in. And
yet when he does come to see me, he looks
and acts as if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then Dick had telephoned about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>box party. “It’s almost never that I can ask
you to anything you really care about,”
he had said, “so do say you’ll come this
time.”</p>

<p>And when Eleanor had accepted, declaring
that she always enjoyed doing things with him,
he had taken her challenge. “Then I shall
ask a pretty girl for your brother and two dull
pairs of devoted people who won’t bother us.
Remember it’s to be our very own party&mdash;only
I can’t come for you because ‘The Quiver’
goes to press that night, and I shall have a
form to ‘O. K.’ between seven and eight.”</p>

<p>Eleanor decided to wear her new yellow
dress. At noon a huge bunch of violets arrived
with Dick’s card. At three Jim sent
a messenger for his evening clothes. He
wouldn’t be able to get home to dinner. He
might come for Eleanor at quarter to eight;
if not, he would send a cab. Eleanor went
across the street very early to the hotel where
they took their dinners, and afterward slipped
out of her street clothes and into a kimono,
and curled up on the couch by the sitting-room
fire to rest until it was time to dress
for the evening. By and by she stretched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>luxuriously, sat up, and without turning on a
light went down the hall to her room. As
she felt for the electric switch a low angry
growl sounded from within. It was Peter
Pan, Jim’s new bulldog. He was feeling
neglected, probably. Jim took him for a
walk or romped with him indoors nearly
every evening.</p>

<p>“Why, Peter!” Eleanor called persuasively.
“Poor old Peter Pan! Were you lonely and
bored and very cross?”</p>

<p>Another growl, and the noise of Peter’s
claws digging into the matting, as he scrambled
to his feet. Eleanor turned on the light
hastily, but Peter, unpropitiated and growling
angrily, came forward a step or two and stood
defiantly, ready to resist any encroachment
on his domain.</p>

<p>“Why, Peter, you silly dog,” coaxed
Eleanor. “Don’t you know me? Did you
think I was a burglar coming in the dark to
rob your dear master? Well, I’m not. Come
here, Peter, good dog!”</p>

<p>Generally Peter would have come pattering
across the floor, eager to lick Eleanor’s hand.
To-night he only growled again and showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>his teeth. Eleanor had had very little experience
with dogs, and she was horribly
frightened at Peter’s extraordinary behavior.
She remembered that when she came down
to New York and was introduced to the apartment
and to the room that Jim had moved
out of because it was the largest and pleasantest
he had to offer her, Jim had warned her
to “go slow” with Peter Pan.</p>

<p>“He seems to have a little prejudice against
strangers, especially ladies,” Jim had said.
“He snapped pretty hard at the janitor’s wife
one day when she was making my bed. She
won’t come in now unless he’s out or chained.
Don’t try to pet him if he acts cross. He
may resent your moving into my special
quarters.”</p>

<p>But Peter Pan had never acted cross or regarded
Eleanor as an interloper, and Eleanor
had petted him, taken him walking in the
park, and quite forgotten Jim’s warning until
now.</p>

<p>“Peter,” began Eleanor desperately again,
“please stop growling. I’ve got to dress, and
to do that I’ve got to come in where you are
and go right past you to my dressing-room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>Now be a good dog and cheer up.” Peter
Pan paid no attention to this pathetic appeal.
He growled again in a low but menacing key,
and yawned, showing all his teeth once more
in the process.</p>

<p>Eleanor shivered and retreated a step or two
so that she could see the clock in the sitting-room.
Twenty minutes past seven; if Jim
came for her, she could dress and arrive
late, but if not&mdash;&mdash; On a chair near the
door of her room were the walking skirt
and blouse she had taken off. Near by
were her black pumps. She had changed
her stockings to a pair of pale yellow silk
ones, leaving those she had taken off in the
dressing-room, with her yellow dress and
evening cape. Unless Jim came, she must
appear at Dick’s party in yellow stockings,
black shoes, a mussy linen blouse, and a blue
serge street-suit, or she must pass that growling
dog twice in order to get her evening
things. She wouldn’t be downed! There
was a dog-whip in the hall; she would get
that and armed with it make the fatal dash.
Then she remembered Jim’s warning. “He’s
a dandy dog, but a puppy’s temper is always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>uncertain. So go slow and don’t get near
him when he’s low in his mind.”</p>

<p>Visions of herself pinioned helplessly in
Peter Pan’s vise-like grip until Jim, frightened
at her failure to appear at the theatre,
should appear, perhaps after she had endured
hours of agony, to rescue her, kept Eleanor
from going after the dog-whip. Bulldogs
did maim and even kill people. Even a yellow
dress, chosen especially to suit Dick’s
fastidious taste, wasn’t worth that risk. But
if she went in her street suit they would
all laugh at her and say that there wasn’t
any risk. Two big tears dropped from Eleanor’s
eyes and rolled down her cheeks.
She brushed them away scornfully, and
crooning soft speeches to Peter Pan reached
for the black pumps, the mussy blouse, and
the walking skirt. Having secured them,
she slammed the door upon the hateful dog,
locked it, and dressed before the tiny mirror
over the mantelpiece. Her tricorn hat and
her coat were in the hall, but Dick’s violets
were in the dressing-room. Eleanor almost
wept again as she thought of them. If only
Jim came for her! But he didn’t&mdash;he sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>a puffing taxi, whose driver stared curiously
at her yellow stockings as he held open the
door for her.</p>

<p>Everybody in the theatre lobby seemed to
be staring. Eleanor’s face flushed as she hurried
to Dick’s box. As she pulled back the
curtain Dick jumped to meet her&mdash;and he
stared at her stockings. The dull devoted ladies
and the pretty girl for Jim were in very
elaborate evening gowns&mdash;and they stared at
her stockings, then at her mussy shirt-waist,
and her plain little hat.</p>

<p>“Introduce me quick,” pleaded Eleanor
softly to Dick, who was trying to take her
coat, “and then I can explain my clothes.
No, I can’t take off my coat. It’s all the fault
of that horrid, hateful Peter Pan.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled at her blandly. “You look
just as lovely as usual. In fact I like you
best of all in plain dark things. Didn’t some
violets come?”</p>

<p>“They were in the dressing-room too, behind
that miserable dog. If Jim ever comes&mdash;I
must sit somewhere back in a corner.”</p>

<p>“You must sit there with me beside you.”
Dick pointed to a chair in the front of the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you really mind?” demanded Eleanor.
“Of course the stockings are the worst,
and they won’t show&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I asked <i>you</i> to come to our very own
party,” Dick told her, “not your clothes.
I’ve got plenty of clothes here already. Come
and meet them, and tell them about the horrid
Peter Pan. Did he chew up your entire
wardrobe while you were out?”</p>

<p>It was a very funny story when once you
were free to see it that way. The dull devoted
couples got quite hysterical over it. Jim,
when he came, was almost as bad, though he
assured his sister soberly that she had done
very well to “play safe” when Peter Pan was
low in his mind.</p>

<p>“Most girls think all a man cares for is
clothes,” said Dick, as the orchestra played
with lowered lights waiting for the first curtain.</p>

<p>“And most men think a girl cares only for
flowers and candy and suppers.”</p>

<p>“Before the wedding&mdash;and clothes and servants
and all the luxuries she’s used to afterward,”
added Dick a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“Whereas,” Eleanor took him up, “if a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>girl loves a man, she is willing to do without
all but the plainest, simplest necessities.
What she wants is a chance to help him, to
be with him through thick and thin, to watch
him make good, and to feel that she has a
little bit of a share in the fine things he’s
doing and going to do.”</p>

<p>She never could have said it if the lights
had been on. She even flushed in the dark
as she saw Dick lean forward to look into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” he asked eagerly, “that
you’d feel that way yourself?”</p>

<p>“I mean that any and every nice girl feels
that way.”</p>

<p>Just then the curtain went up, but for all
Dick’s interest in Madeline’s play, his hand
was crushing one of Eleanor’s, and his heart
was pounding so hard that the first act was
half over before he had gathered his wits to
know what it was all about.</p>

<p>The minute the curtain rang down, Dick
turned to Eleanor. “In that case,” he said under
cover of the applause, “you’ve got to promise
to marry me now. I can give you a
good deal besides love and a chance to help,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>but I’ve waited almost two years without daring
to say a word, and I’ve been frightened to
death for fear I should lose you to some fellow
who could speak sooner.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have worried,” Eleanor told
him, “because I was waiting too. But I consider
that you’ve wasted two whole years for
me out of my life. You’ll have that to make
up for, monsieur. Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I can only try,” said Dick very soberly.</p>

<p>The play was a triumph for Miss Dwight
and for the author. That young person was
sitting alone in the last row of the peanut gallery.
Occasionally she pinched herself to
make sure that she was awake, and just before
the final curtain fell she crept softly out and
went home by herself in a jolting, jangling
Broadway car. There Dick and Eleanor
found her rocking by the fire, the inevitable
black kitten in her lap.</p>

<p>“Come to supper,” Dick said. “You promised,
and the taxi waits.”</p>

<p>Madeline smiled dreamily up at them and
patted the kitten. “Yes, Dick, I’ll come to
supper as long as I needn’t dress up for it.
What’s the matter, Eleanor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“I want to know how you knew,” demanded
Eleanor eagerly. “How you guessed
exactly how I’ve felt all these years about&mdash;about
everything and&mdash;and Dick.”</p>

<p>Madeline smiled. “If every woman in the
audience wants to know that,” she said, “the
play goes. The shop-girl next me in the gallery
wants to know, and Miss Dwight, and now
you&mdash;&mdash; Excuse me, Eleanor, but where did
you get those stockings?”</p>

<span class="smaller">A GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK&mdash;WITH “FEATURES”</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Babe</span> seized upon Eleanor’s engagement as
the best possible excuse for a week-end party.</p>

<p>“Living in a castle is rather a fright,” she
confided to Betty. “John doesn’t mind it,
because he’s always lived in a near-castle. I
get lost. I’m afraid of the butler. The English
housekeeper drops her aitches so fast
that I can’t tell what she wants to ask me. I
forget the names of my horses. And when
John is in town I haven’t anybody to play
with.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re not a very enthusiastic
newly-wed,” Betty told her laughingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am,” Babe declared very earnestly.
“I love John, and I love Father Morton,
and I love my house. Only I rattle
around in it like a pea in a band-box. While
I’m growing up to fit my surroundings I’ve
got to have the assistance of all my friends.
Will you come to my party, Betty? I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>going to ask Father Morton, because he knows
Mr. Blake, and besides he missed all the fun
of the wedding.”</p>

<p>So Betty, resolving to “’tend up” to business
strictly for the rest of the year, took another
week-end off to celebrate the engagement,
see Babe’s gorgeous mansion, and help make
up to Mr. Morton for losing the wedding&mdash;all
on her account, as he persisted in saying.</p>

<p>Babe’s house, which had been Mr. Morton’s
wedding gift to her, was up on the Hudson,
in a suburb so discreetly removed from the
noise and dust of the railroad that nobody
lived there except “carriage people.” The
wide roads wound in sweeping curves along
the river, between lilac hedges, now capped
with snow. In front, Babe’s territory sloped
through great gardens to the water; behind
she had a real wood of her own. Inside the
house the stately rooms were crowded with
expensive furniture and beautiful bric-à-brac.
Mr. Morton had taken Babe shopping and
bought everything she had as much as stopped
to look at. A famous decorator had been
sent up to arrange the house and fill in the
gaps. There was a fireplace taken bodily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>from a Florentine palace, a Rembrandt that
had once graced a royal gallery, a rug that
men had spent their whole lives in weaving.</p>

<p>“I shall never know what we’ve got,”
sighed Babe, as she led the way through her
domain. “Father Morton loves to surprise
people. He says I haven’t discovered half
the special features that he’s put in just to
amuse me.”</p>

<p>“If I were you I should feel like a princess
in a fairy tale,” sighed little Helen Adams,
who had never in her life imagined anything
half so splendid.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Babe stoutly. “Princesses
have to wear long velvet dresses and look
sweet all the time. Just as soon as I dare,
I’m going to get rid of at least half the servants,
so I can roll up my sleeves and go
down to the kitchen. I learned to make
bread at cooking-school before I was married,
and it was a picnic.” Babe paused and gazed
joyously at her guests. “I’ve thought what
would be a picnic to do right on this very afternoon,
before you’ve even seen the rest of
the house. To play hide-and-go-seek.”</p>

<p>“Babe,” began Mary Brooks sternly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>“you’re still the Perfect Infant. Do you
think it befits married ladies like you and me
to indulge in children’s games?”</p>

<p>Babe answered by running down the long
hall, pulling the reluctant Mary after her.</p>

<p>“John,” she cried when they reached the
little library that John had seized upon for
his den and in which he was now entertaining
the masculine portion of the house party,
“John, we’re going to play hide-and-seek all
over the house. Isn’t that a grand idea?”</p>

<p>“Great,” agreed the devoted John.</p>

<p>“Then come along, everybody,” ordered
Babe. “Will you play too, Father Morton?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Jasper J. Morton
testily. “One of the things this house is intended
for is a good game of hide-and-seek.
I didn’t forget that you were a little tomboy,
child. I didn’t expect you to grow up all at
once just because you’d promised to love and
obey my boy John.” Jasper J. Morton
paused to chuckle. “Some of the best features
of this house are still undiscovered.
Maybe they’ll come out in the course of this
game.”</p>

<p>Babe hugged him rapturously. “We discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
the hidden bowling-alley last week,”
she said. “You were a duck to put in so
many surprises right under my very nose,
when I thought I was picking out everything
and doing all the planning myself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton laughed gleefully. “You like
my surprises, do you? Independently of
their being surprises, I mean. When young
people build a house they never think of the
most important things. For instance, there’s
no reason, just because you’re going to have a
new house, why you shouldn’t keep to some
of the good old ways. Most new houses are
no earthly good for little tomboys to play in.
Do you hear that, Watson? Too bad I got
this place started before I met you. You’d
have learned a lot of things about your business
if you’d built this house for me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that, sir,” said Jim dutifully.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open this afternoon,”
Mr. Morton advised him mysteriously.
“There are features in this house that the
head of your firm wouldn’t be capable of inventing.
Architects are like sheep&mdash;they follow
the last fashions. Now when I’ve been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>abroad, I’ve studied buildings over there.
When I see a good thing in some old house in
a little moss-grown town like Harding, I remember
it. I also study character. Just as
Morton Hall is adapted to Miss B. A. and her
protégées, so this place is adapted to John and
this little tomboy. I exercise prevision when
I build. Why, I foresaw this very game of
hide-and-seek, so to speak. Just give a little
study to the habits and tastes of your clients,
my boy, and you’ll make a name for yourself.
That’s the way to build; study character and
exercise foresight.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Jim respectfully.</p>

<p>“Eny, meeny, miny, mo,” began Babe hastily,
having had quite enough of architectural
theories. The lot of being “it” first fell
upon her, and John’s den was chosen as
goal.</p>

<p>“Remember,” Babe told them, “you can
go anywhere except to the kitchen. I
shouldn’t dare to chase you there. Open any
door that you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Particularly any door you don’t quite
see,” put in Jasper J. Morton mysteriously.</p>

<p>“It’s too early for skeletons,” laughed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>John, “so you needn’t be afraid of the
closets.”</p>

<p>“I shall count my hundred awfully fast,”
announced Babe, suiting the action to the
words with a promptness that sent her guests
scuttling for hiding-places.</p>

<p>The first person to be caught was Helen
Adams, who confessed that she hadn’t dared
to go into any rooms but the down-stairs ones
that were obviously meant for guests; and nobody
had gone far or had happened upon any
very difficult hiding-places. But the next
time, led by Babe, the party ranged far afield,
and it took so long to find them all that a
ten-minute limit was arranged; after ten minutes’
hunting those who were not found could
“come in free.” Nobody was surprised that
Dick and Eleanor should forget this privilege
at the end of a round, but when Betty had
twice failed to appear Babe declared that she
must have found one of Father Morton’s real
hiding-places, and the whole party started off
in search of her. Up-stairs and down again
they went, opening closets, hunting in chests,
under beds, behind portières. Babe declared
that she was at last learning the way around
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>her domain, and discovering any number of
extra cupboards and closets; but neither she
nor anybody else discovered Betty.</p>

<p>At four the butler caught his flyaway little
mistress long enough to announce to her
that tea was served in the yellow drawing-room.</p>

<p>“We shall have to go,” she said sadly,
rounding up her guests. “I shouldn’t dare
to tell him that we were too busy playing
hide-and-seek. Besides, I’m hungry, for one.
Betty will hear us all in there together, and
know we’ve given her up and come out.
Let’s all shout together ‘We give up’!”</p>

<p>So the big house echoed to their chanted
“We give up,” and then they repaired to the
yellow drawing-room, where Babe sat on a
carved oak throne and poured tea, from a
wonderful silver pot wreathed with dragons,
into cups so fragile that you could have
crushed them as you would a flower. There
were muffins and crackers and sweet sandwiches
and nuts and ginger, all of which
tasted very good to the hungry “hiders.”
And in the midst of tea there was an excitement,
in the shape of a telegram summoning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>Mr. Morton, Senior, to a conference on board
a train that would reach this station in less
than ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Have to miss dinner, I suppose, but I’ll
be back to-night sure,” he grumbled as Babe
pulled on his coat, John found his gloves and
hat, a valet packed his bag, in case of emergency,
and the butler rang for the chauffeur to
bring around a limousine. “Where’s Miss
B. A.?” he demanded as the car appeared.
“Hasn’t she come out yet? Well, if the rest
of you have any gumption, you’ll take her
dare and find her. I say, Watson, you know
how a house is built, and you know that Miss
B. A. is worth finding&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Train’s whistling, dad,” broke in John.</p>

<p>“Then the automobile speed limit has got
to go smash again,” said Jasper J. Morton resignedly,
jumping into the car. “Find her,
Watson. She’s worth it,” he called back,
waving his hand spasmodically as the car
shot round a curve and out of sight.</p>

<p>Most of the young people had gathered in
the hall to see Mr. Morton off, but little
Helen Adams, feeling rather shy and out-of-place,
had crept back into the drawing-room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>which, lighted only by the fire and the
candles on the tea-table, seemed so rich and
dim and lovely that to be alone in it made
her give a long deep sigh of joy and satisfaction
and wonder at the idea of plain little
Helen Chase Adams spending the week-end
with a gay house party in such a splendid
place.</p>

<p>She had just seated herself in a great
cushioned chair by the fire to enjoy it all&mdash;Helen
was one of the people who must be
alone to drink their pleasures to the full&mdash;when
she heard a little tap on the wall so
close to her that it made her jump. But in a
minute she settled back again comfortably.
“Mice or a bit of loose plaster,” she decided.
But an instant later there came a little low
moan&mdash;an eery sort of muffled cry&mdash;and this
time she screamed and jumped quite out of
her chair. The door had just been shut after
Mr. Morton, and Babe came running in, followed
by all the others, and at a respectful
distance by the stately butler, to ask what the
matter was.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” said Helen anxiously.
“Something or somebody cried out in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>another room, and it sounded so near me and
so queer, some way, that I screamed. I’m
sorry I frightened all the rest of you too.”</p>

<p>“Mamie the parlor-maid always gives a
heartrending shriek when she breaks one of
my favorite wedding presents,” suggested
Babe mournfully. “It was probably Mamie&mdash;only
why should she be dusting and breaking
things at this time of day?”</p>

<p>“Why indeed?” demanded Madeline scornfully.
“Did it sound like a pathetic parlor-maid,
Helen?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t sound like any real person,”
Helen explained slowly. “It was muffled
and far away and choked&mdash;like a&mdash;why, like
a ghost!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” cried Madeline triumphantly.
“Babe, don’t you see what’s happened? One
of the highly advertised features of your
domicile has come to light. Your respected
father-in-law, realizing that no castle is complete
without a ghost&mdash;he remembered Babbie’s,
probably&mdash;built in one, warranted to appear
to persons sitting alone in the firelight.
And you try to pretend it’s only a parlor-maid
in distress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“I hope it wasn’t Betty in distress,” put in
Eleanor Watson.</p>

<p>“I’m really afraid she’s locked in somewhere,”
said Babe anxiously. “Didn’t a girl
in an old story once hide in a chest in a game
like this, and get faint and finally smother?
Did the noise sound as if it could have been
Betty, Helen?”</p>

<p>Helen confessed that it might have been almost
anything.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” Babe turned to the butler, “will
you please take two of the servants and hunt
in the cellar for Miss Wales? I’ll take the
up-stairs rooms, and John, you and the men
hunt down here, and then go up to the attic.
Open all the chests and cupboards. Oh, dear,
I wish this house wasn’t so big!”</p>

<p>Search “up-stairs, down-stairs, and in my
lady’s chamber” revealed no Betty. Eleanor,
passing the door of the yellow drawing-room,
thought she heard another cry, but when, reinforced
by Dick and John, she went in to
listen for its repetition, all was still. Nobody
was under the furniture or in the next room,
and the open fires in both rooms made the
chimney an impossible retreat. But it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>from near the chimney that Eleanor thought
the cry had come, and Helen had been sitting
near the fire when it sounded in her ear.</p>

<p>“She must be in one of the secret chambers
that Mr. Morton broadly hinted at,” said
Madeline finally. “But why, if she went in,
doesn’t she come out?”</p>

<p>Jim Watson had been frenziedly active in
searching chests and cupboards. Now he was
knocking on the wall near the fireplace and
running back and forth between the two adjoining
rooms, taking note of the position and
thickness of the partitions.</p>

<p>“There’s a passage between these rooms,”
he announced at last, “and a shaft or a staircase
or something running up in this corner.
See&mdash;there’s a square taken out. But how
you get in, I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do try to see,” begged Babe eagerly.
“You know Father Morton said you could
learn a lot from this house. I wish we knew
for sure that she was in there and”&mdash;Babe
choked a little&mdash;“all right.”</p>

<p>“Knock hard on the wall,” suggested Mr.
Blake. “Maybe she’ll hear that better than
our talking, and answer it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>Regardless of priceless wall-hangings Babe
seized a pair of brass tongs and pounded on
the wall as if she meant to break it down.</p>

<p>“Go easy, Babe,” advised Madeline, but
Babe only pounded harder.</p>

<p>“If she’s in there we want to know that
she’s all right,” declared Babe hotly. “And
then we’ve got to get her out if we have to
batter down this wall to do it.”</p>

<p>“How will you know Betty’s knock from a
ghost’s?” demanded Madeline flippantly, but
no one paid any attention to her because just
at that moment a faint knock did sound on
the other side of the wall.</p>

<p>Babe gave a little cry of relief. “Then she
isn’t suffocated! That story has just been
haunting me. Now, Mr. Watson, you know
how a house is built, to quote Father Morton.
You must find how to get to her.”</p>

<p>Jim looked as if he wanted to use the tongs
as a battering-ram, but he refrained. “I’ll
try up-stairs,” he said. “Maybe the entrance
is there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you which rooms are over these,”
volunteered John.</p>

<p>But there was no opening up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>It was Helen Adams who made the next
suggestion. “If a stairway goes up, mightn’t
it go down too? Perhaps you can enter from
the cellar.”</p>

<p>And sure enough half-way down the cellar
stairs Jim discovered a little door.</p>

<p>“May be a snap lock that’s kept her in,”
he muttered irritably. “Hold it open, Eleanor.
Here, Thomas, let’s have your electric
bug. Hello, Betty! Betty, I say!”</p>

<p>“Here I am,” called a faint, frightened little
voice from up above. “Here I am, but where
I am I don’t know, and I think I’ve sprained
my ankle.”</p>

<p>Ensconced on the couch in John’s den Betty
had her belated tea, while Babe rubbed the
turned ankle vigorously, and the others stood
around listening to the tale of ghostly adventures.</p>

<p>“I got in up-stairs,” Betty explained,
“through a sliding panel sort of thing that
opens out of that curved part of the hall.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Of course,” Jim put in. “We looked on
the other side.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE OTHERS STOOD AROUND LISTENING</p>

<p class="p2">“I shut the door so no one else would find
it,” explained Betty, “and of course it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>pretty dark, though there is a little high window
opening into the hall to light the first
part of the passage.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;looks like a ventilator,” interrupted
Jim again.</p>

<p>“But when I came to the flight of stairs, I
didn’t see them,” Betty took up her story,
“and I wasn’t expecting stairs, so I fell most
of the way down and landed with one foot
under me. I was frightened and the pain
made me faint. I called once, but nobody
answered. I felt as if I was in an old dungeon,
like those we saw in France, and if I moved
or called rats would come and bite me, or I
should drop into a well and drown. Besides,
I hadn’t the least idea how to get back. Of
course it was perfectly silly. I called once
more after a long while, and once I thought I
heard some one scream. And then, ages after,
there were knocks and I knocked back.
That’s all. Did some one really scream or
did I imagine that?”</p>

<p>“I did. I thought it was a ghost,” explained
Helen.</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I’m pursued by ghosts
these days. The Morton Hall girls hear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>them, and Dorothy and poor little Shirley
Ware&mdash;why, I wonder if there could be a
secret passageway at Miss Dick’s! It’s an
old, rambling sort of house. I must ask
about it when I go back.”</p>

<p>But by the time Betty had spent a week on
a couch at Babe’s, recovering from her
sprained ankle, her mind was so full of more
important things which must be attended to
“at once if not sooner,” to quote Emily’s
delightful formula, that she quite forgot to
inquire of Miss Dick about the secret passage.
It was better, too, perhaps, to let sleeping dogs
lie. Shirley was back at school again, and
her wan little face must be a sad reminder to
any big girl who had played a practical joke
on her. Miss Dick still felt sure that there
had been no joke&mdash;that Shirley had conjured
up a ghost out of her own imagination. It
would be a bad plan, possibly, to stir the
matter up again.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> least once every week Betty dropped
into Mrs. Post’s room to talk over the progress
of their charges and the state of the house in
general.</p>

<p>“The Goop is as bad as ever,” Betty complained
one windy afternoon in March. “I’ve
just been up in her room&mdash;she’s begun again
throwing whatever she doesn’t need at the
moment under her bed, and whenever she’s
in a hurry or especially happy at meal times
she shovels things in with her knife. Do you
think she ought to be allowed to stay here
another year?”</p>

<p>“Maybe she’ll decide to stop studying and
teach for a while,” suggested the optimistic
Mrs. Post. “She’s thinking of it. But if it’s
important for her to learn tidiness and table
manners&mdash;which it certainly is&mdash;she certainly
is more likely to do it here than anywhere
else, with me nagging at her and you looking
sweet and sorry. Now I’ll warrant she’s down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>on her knees this very minute clearing up her
floor, because you saw it looking disorderly.
She thinks a lot of pleasing you. And the
other girls don’t mind her habits much; she’s
good for them as a horrible example.”</p>

<p>“The Twin Digs have been reported again
for lights after ten,” said Betty, who was in a
downhearted mood.</p>

<p>“Only once since&mdash;since&mdash;well, I’m afraid
I can’t truthfully say since Christmas,”
laughed Mrs. Post. “I guess what those two
need is a show of firmness. I’ll see them to-night
and tell them that the very next time
means a report to President Wallace.”</p>

<p>“Miss Romance has had three callers again
this week, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Three calls, but only one caller. She’s
settled down to one now, and I guess he’s all
right&mdash;he seems to be a real nice country
boy. He lives in the little place where she
does, and he walks six miles and back each
time he comes to call. Seems to me that
shows he’s fond enough of her to mean business.
As for her, college is all nonsense for a
girl like that. She hasn’t sense enough to
take it in. She’d better be at work or helping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>her mother, or making a home of her own.
She’ll always be silly and rattle-pated and
provoking to sensible people, as long as she
lives. I’ve told her so&mdash;I mean I’ve advised
her not to struggle along here through the
whole course.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed. “I suppose you’re right.
Not every girl is capable of getting much out
of college. Well, anyway, there’s always the
Thorn to congratulate ourselves on. She’s
really turning out to be a very pleasant, helpful
person to have in the house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Post nodded. “She’s your triumph,
and Esther Bond is mine. She says she’s
been happier down in this room talking to
me about my three girls and the weather and
the price of eggs and the way the laundry
tears our linen than she’s been before in her
whole life. I wish I could make her see that
if she enjoys being friends with a stupid old
lady like me, she’d enjoy ten times more being
intimate with girls of her own age. She
doesn’t dispute me. She just smiles that terribly
tragic smile of hers, shakes her head,
and changes the subject.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose some one has hurt her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>feelings?” asked Betty. “Or is she just
naturally secretive and reserved?”</p>

<p>“She’s naturally very confiding,” declared
Mrs. Post. “Seems as if she was friends with
everybody in the village where she lived when
she was little. Something’s happened, and
it’s happened since she came here, I think.
But whatever it is she’s bound nobody shall
ever know about it. And when she makes
up her mind she makes it up hard and to
stay.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the ghost noises have stopped,
or if the Thorn has just suppressed the reports?”
Betty queried. “I never quite understood
why the Mystery didn’t complain
the day they nearly battered down her door.”</p>

<p>“She’s never even mentioned it to me,”
Mrs. Post declared. “She seems to hate to
talk about anything connected with her college
life. She acts smart enough. She
doesn’t have any trouble keeping up with her
classes, does she?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “She’s very good
in most things&mdash;I asked Miss Ferris about her&mdash;only
she never answers except when she’s
asked directly, and then she says just as little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>as she can. Miss Raymond had her over one
day this winter to tell her that her themes
were very promising, only they stopped just
when the reader was beginning to be interested.
But Miss Bond said she always wrote
down all that she thought of on each subject,
and she acted so frightened and unhappy that
Miss Raymond let her go home and hasn’t
tried to encourage her since. It must be
dreadful to be so shy that every one thinks
you’re offish, and even the faculty don’t dare
to pursue their efforts to help you along.
Just think, Mrs. Post! She might be one of
the leading writers in her class, if she’d only
let Miss Raymond take an interest in her
work. Couldn’t you talk to her about it?
I’m sure she’d enjoy the recognition, and perhaps
when she felt that she had a position of
her own in the college she’d be willing to
come out of her shell and make friends.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to lead up to it some way,” Mrs.
Post promised warily. “She never wants to
talk about college affairs, you see.”</p>

<p>A night or two later Betty was awakened
out of a sound sleep by one of the Twin Digs,
who stood over her with a candle, explaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>in a sepulchral whisper, “There’s a girl in a
fire-escape dangling outside my window.”</p>

<p>Betty rubbed her eyes, sat up, and, having
thus assured herself that she was not dreaming
nonsense, asked the Dig what she meant.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s a girl in a fire-escape dangling
outside my window,” repeated the Dig
hopelessly. “You know the new rope fire-escapes
that are in all our rooms? Well, she
evidently got into one up on the fourth floor,
and started to slide to the ground, and somehow
it’s stuck with her half-way down. I
mean the part you put over your shoulders,
that’s on a pulley to slide down the rope, has
stuck and won’t slide. I couldn’t possibly
pull her in alone, and I thought I’d better
call you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.” Betty jumped out of
bed, and followed her incoherent informant
up-stairs to a third floor single. The window
was wide open and, sure enough, just out of
reach, a girl, clearly visible in the moonlight,
hung in mid-air, clinging to a dangling rope.
When she saw the two figures appear in the
lighted window, instead of calling to them or
asking help or advice, she threw her whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>weight on the rope and gave one furious jerk.
The pulley suddenly began to work again and,
caught unprepared, she lost her hold on the
rope. It slipped swiftly through her fingers
and she was carried downward at a terrific
rate, landing with a thud on the rose bed under
the window.</p>

<p>Betty and the Dig had watched her descent
in helpless horror. Now Betty seized the
candle and raced down-stairs and out into the
cold night, the Dig automatically following.
Round to the back of the house they went,
both expecting to find a senseless body,
bruised and bleeding, on the ground. Instead
a girl was walking rather stiffly out
from among the burlap-swathed rose-bushes.</p>

<p>“I’m not hurt,” she called softly. “You’ll
catch cold. Run back to your beds, please,
and don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>Betty paused in amazement, and suddenly
realizing that it was indeed bitterly cold for
kimonos and Turkish slippers over bare feet
she thrust the candle, which the moonlight
rendered useless, into the Dig’s hands, and
ordered her back into the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll come and see you later,” she explained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>“Take the catch off the door for me. I want
to be sure she really isn’t hurt, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty hurried off. It wasn’t necessary to
explain to the Dig how college discipline
demanded that she discover the identity of
the girl, and her reasons for making an exit
from Morton Hall in so unconventional a
fashion.</p>

<p>The girl was limping down the road toward
the Belden House. “Wait!” Betty called,
running after her. “It’s Miss Wales. I must
speak to you a minute.”</p>

<p>The girl paused, glanced around as if counting
the chances of escape, and waited.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hurt?” Betty demanded as she
came closer. “We thought the fall would
surely stun you. Your hands must be terribly
cut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not much,” the girl answered, putting
them resolutely behind her. “I had on
gloves. And there was a little snow on the
ground close to the house, to break the fall.
You want to know who I am, Miss Wales, and
what I was doing in the Morton so late.
Well, it’s all very simple. I’m Helena Mason.
I was up talking to Esther Bond and we got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>interested and didn’t hear either of the bells.
I hated to bother any one to let me out, so I
told Esther I’d slide down the fire-escape&mdash;it’s
good practice for a fire. And because it stuck
for a minute some silly girl imagined I needed
help and called you. I’m sorry you were disturbed.
The night-watchman will be along
soon&mdash;if I can’t make some girl hear me right
away and let me in. Won’t you please go
back now?”</p>

<p>Betty was shivering with cold. “Yes, and
you must come with me,” she said. “You
limp dreadfully. Waiting out in the cold after
a fall like that would be positively dangerous.
The girl who rooms next to me is away, and
you can go to bed there.”</p>

<p>“But I’d much rather go home,” Helena
demurred. “I won’t have to wait but a
minute, and I’m not at all cold.”</p>

<p>“You’re shivering this minute,” Betty told
her, “and your hands are cut so that they’re
bleeding on to the ground. You must come
and let me fix them for you.” And putting
her arm through Helena’s she hurried her
back to Morton Hall.</p>

<p>Helena submitted in silence while Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>bathed and bandaged the torn hands, and
helped her to undress.</p>

<p>“Now shall I tell Esther to come and say
good-night?” she asked. “I’m going to tell
the girl who discovered you that you’re really
all right&mdash;we couldn’t believe our eyes when
you got up and walked off&mdash;and I’ll go on up
and tell Esther too. She must have seen you
fall and she’ll be worrying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, she didn’t,” Helena assured her.
“Please don’t disturb her, Miss Wales. I’m
sure she’s sound asleep. And Miss Wales&mdash;will
you have to tell the other girl&mdash;the one
who saw me&mdash;who I am? I’d so much rather
not. People will laugh at me so.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be thankful they haven’t got
to mourn for you,” laughed Betty. “I can’t
see how you escaped being badly hurt. Well,
I won’t mention any name then, Miss Mason;
only in return you must promise me never to
go out of our house by such a dangerous route
again.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” agreed the girl. “You see I
didn’t know you or Mrs. Post, and I thought
you might be awfully cross at my having
stayed after ten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>“But Esther knew us,” Betty protested.
“She oughtn’t to have let you try such a
thing in the dark and cold unless there was a
real necessity for it.”</p>

<p>“She had nothing to say about it, Miss
Wales,” explained Helena coldly. “I’ve
often&mdash;I’m not a bit afraid of a fire-escape,
and I just said so and went ahead. She had
nothing to do with it at all.”</p>

<p>The Dig was awake and waiting for Betty.
She listened eagerly to the scant news that
was vouchsafed her, and pointedly did not
inquire Helena’s name.</p>

<p>“She knows who it was,” Betty guessed
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Let’s not say anything about it,” she suggested
aloud. “It might frighten the girls
about trying the new fire-escapes, and it will
make this particular girl seem very absurd.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the Dig briskly. “But
such things always do get out, Miss Wales.
Other people must have seen her hanging
there or heard her fall and then the talking
afterward.”</p>

<p>Betty crept up to the fourth floor, and
knocked very softly on Esther Bond’s door.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>Instantly the door was unlocked, and Esther
demanded nervously what the matter was.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” Betty quieted her, “but I
thought you might know that Helena got carried
down too fast on her fire-escape, so I
came to tell you that she’s all right, only
bruised a little and her hands are cut.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know she fell,” said Esther
apathetically, “but I heard you talking to
her, and wondered why you had gone out
after her. I’m glad she’s not hurt.”</p>

<p>“Next time you mustn’t let her try such a
thing,” Betty told her gravely. “Call me
and I’ll let out anybody who has stayed too
late by mistake.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a mistake, Miss Wales,” Esther
explained calmly. “Helena wasn’t ready to
go at ten, so she stayed; that’s all. She
comes here when she likes and goes when she
likes, and as she likes. If you’re blaming me
for this you don’t know Helena Mason.”</p>

<p>Helena insisted upon leaving before breakfast
the next morning. Her hands were sore,
and she was stiff and bruised all over, but she
managed to dress without help, and insisted
that she was well enough to get her books
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>and go to her classes. At noon she was back
again, nervously inquiring for Betty.</p>

<p>“I lost a paper last night, Miss Wales,”
she explained. “I had tucked it into my
ulster pocket. Did you pick it up, or has
anybody in this house found it and brought
it to you or Mrs. Post?”</p>

<p>Betty had not seen the paper, but she promised
to inquire. The Thorn, it developed,
had found it that morning and given it to
Esther Bond.</p>

<p>“It was in her writing,” she explained.
“It was a Lit. paper, and a dandy one too. I
read it. Wish I’d seen it before I handed
mine in.” She grinned cheerfully. “I can
say that to you, Miss Wales, because you can
tell a joke when you see one. Helena Mason
can’t. Rather than be laughed at for her fire-escape
escapade she’s given the impression
that she burned her hands with her student
lamp. And the people who know what really
happened are smiling a little and wondering
a lot.”</p>

<p>A week later the Thorn came to Betty
again, her eyes round with amazement. “I’m
not a gossip, Miss Wales,” she began, “but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>that paper&mdash;the one in Esther Bond’s writing
that Miss Mason lost and I found&mdash;was read
to-day in Lit. 6, as the best one handed
in. And it was signed by Helena Mason. I
wish now that I hadn’t read it. I never
thought there was any harm in reading a
theme that you happened to pick up.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of harm in jumping to
conclusions,” Betty warned her hastily.
“Helena’s writing may be so like Esther’s
that it deceived you, or Esther may have
copied Helena’s paper for her. That’s the
right explanation, I’m sure. A good many
girls hire their papers copied, you know.”</p>

<p>The Thorn sighed and stared at Betty
admiringly. “And I never saw any possibility
except that Helena Mason had hired her
theme written. I must have a horrid, suspicious
mind, I suppose, Miss Wales. I’m
glad I came right to you first, and I shan’t
mention the matter to any one else.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MYSTERY SOLVED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Post</span> had the grippe. “Why couldn’t
I have waited until the spring vacation?”
she sighed forlornly. “Then this house
would be empty, and my daughter&mdash;the one
who’s a nurse&mdash;was coming up anyway to
visit me. And now I’m bothering everybody
and making lots of extra trouble.”</p>

<p>Betty reassured her tactfully. “It’s not
the busy season for Student’s Aid secretaries,”
she said. “Whatever of your work I specially
don’t like, I shall saddle on some girl.
They’re all crazy to do things for you. It’s
worth being ill once in a while to see how
much people think of you.”</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Betty remembered that
she had forgotten to distribute towels on the
fourth floor, and went up to see about it.
The Mystery’s door was open, she noticed, and
a group of fourth floor girls were inside,
eagerly admiring a dress that had just come
to the Thorn from home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>Betty threw them a merry word of greeting
and went on to the linen closet. It was a
cloudy afternoon and the tiny high window
let in very little light. “I must write to Jim
to complain of his dark linen-presses,” she
thought, with a smile. And then, reaching
out her hand to draw the curtain away from
some shelves, she jumped back with a scream
of terror. Her hand had hit the head of
somebody who was crouched in a heap behind
the curtains. Betty’s cry brought half a
dozen girls on the run to the linen-closet door.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” Betty told them, clinging
to the door-post to steady herself, for she was
trembling with fright. “That is&mdash;now, girls,
don’t scream or faint or do anything foolish.
Some one had hidden in there&mdash;some girl in
the house, perhaps, for fun. Whoever it is
won’t hurt us here all together in broad daylight.
Now come out, please,” called Betty,
raising her voice and looking hard at the curtains.</p>

<p>There was a moment of awful stillness and
then a tall girl straightened to her full height
behind the quivering curtains and came forward,
flushing hotly, to the door. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>Helena Mason. She paid no attention to
Betty and the girls about her but, looking
over their heads, faced Esther Bond, who
stood watching the scene with a curious air of
detachment from the door of her room. And
the look that Helena Mason gave her said as
plainly as words could have done, “I hate
you. I hate you. I hate you.”</p>

<p>But the look the Mystery sent back said,
“I am beyond hating you or any one else.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Betty and the
girls with her were too amazed to speak, and
Helena Mason stood quietly defiant, as if daring
any one to question her. At last the
Thorn, gay in her new dress, broke the tension.</p>

<p>“Come on down to my room, girls, and
finish your inspection of me there,” she suggested.
“Miss Wales doesn’t need any more
protection. We’re just in the way here now.”</p>

<p>They caught her point instantly, and
trooped after her down-stairs, leaving Betty,
Helena, and the Mystery to settle the matter
as best they might. When they had gone
Helena laughed a strained little laugh and
began to explain herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“You’re always catching me in absurd
situations, Miss Wales. But this can be explained
as easily as the fire-escape affair. I’m
sure you know I wasn’t trying to steal your
sheets and towels. I had a reason for not
wanting the girls in the house to know
I was in Esther’s room to-day, so when I
came up-stairs and found some of them with
her, I slipped in here to wait till they’d gone;
and you came and found me. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Betty had been thinking fast. “But the
door was locked, Miss Mason&mdash;it is kept
locked. How did you manage to get in and
then lock it again?”</p>

<p>Helena flushed. “The key to any of these
doors will unlock any other, Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>“But where did you get such a key?”
Betty persisted. “How did you happen to
have one ready to-day?”</p>

<p>“I took it out of one of the doors over
there.” Helena pointed vaguely toward a
cluster of empty rooms.</p>

<p>“Where is it now?” Betty demanded.</p>

<p>Helena flushed redder than ever. “I’m
sure I don’t know&mdash;on the floor in there, probably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>Betty got a match and began groping
around on the floor of the linen room. But
after a minute Esther Bond, who had said
nothing so far, came forward and confronted
Helena.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell the truth at once?”
she asked. “You’ll have to in the end.
Don’t hunt there, Miss Wales. She’s wearing
the key on her watch-chain.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me, please,” Betty said, coming
out into the light. She noticed that Helena
took her watch off the chain first, and then
slipped out the key. “So you didn’t take it
to-day,” she said.</p>

<p>“I never said when I took it,” Helena
flashed back angrily. “I’ve had it several
weeks, if you want to know. The girls in
this house are bores and frightfully curious.
Whenever I don’t want to see them and have
them fussing around, why, I come in here
and wait till Esther is alone. There’s no
great harm in that, as far as I can see. I’ve
done it all winter.”</p>

<p>Betty was frankly puzzled what to answer.
“Why, no&mdash;except that you gave me a dreadful
fright just now,” she said slowly. “And&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Miss Mason, there is harm in it. It’s a
sly and sneaking way of acting. No girl
would hide in here as you say you have done
without a good reason, and the reason can’t
but be discreditable. I don’t ask you to tell
me what it is, but I do ask you and Esther to
talk it over and think what you ought to do
about it. And if you want any advice from
me or Mrs. Post, when she’s better, or want to
tell us anything in justice to yourselves or the
house, why, we shall be only too glad to
help.”</p>

<p>Betty gathered up her towels and departed,
hoping she had said the right thing and
devoutly wishing, as she caught a glimpse of
herself in a mirror, that she looked older and
more impressive, the better to emphasize her
good advice. Half-way down the stairs she
halted. “Why, she’s the ghost!” she said
to herself. “I’ve caught our ghost! How
queer that I never thought of that till now.
And I’m afraid that in this case the Thorn is
right about the connection between ghosts and
somebody’s wrong-doing. Either Helena Mason
is crazy, or she’s hiding something that
she’s ashamed of. I wish Esther would tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>Mrs. Post all about it. It’s so queer that it
worries me.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later there was a knock on
Betty’s door. The Mystery, a strained, frightened
look in her big eyes, stood outside.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to explain myself,” she said.
“You’ve been very kind, and Mrs. Post&mdash;I
couldn’t bear to have her know this, Miss
Wales. But I owe it to you that you should
understand, and then I want you to advise
me. Helena wouldn’t come. She has decided
what to do, she says&mdash;she will leave
college at the spring recess. I am as bad as
she in a way, and perhaps I ought to leave
too. Indeed, I may have to.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning and tell me about
it,” urged Betty.</p>

<p>The Mystery nodded. “It began when we
were little girls. She and her mother used to
spend the summers in our village. Her
mother took a fancy to me. She used to tell
us that if Helena had my brains or I Helena’s
face she should have an ideal daughter. She’s
very ambitious. She was always pushing
Helena along in her schools&mdash;bringing down
tutors in the summer to teach her languages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>and coach her in her theme-work. She let
me study with them, too, because she thought
my work would inspire Helena. Helena
hates to study, and hasn’t much head for it.
Her mother had set her heart on her coming
to Harding and making a name for herself
here. When she heard that I wanted dreadfully
to come, she sent for me and offered to
pay my expenses if I would help Helena, especially
in theme-work.</p>

<p>“I never thought how it would be&mdash;it
sounded all right&mdash;like tutoring. So I
promised. Helena insisted that I should
live off at the end of nowhere, so she could
come to me without any one’s finding it out.
I soon saw what she wanted of me&mdash;not tutoring,
but help. I was to write all her papers,
take all her notes and read them to
her,&mdash;do all her work and see that she got the
credit. At the end of last year I got tired of
it, and I thought I could pay my own way.
But when I spoke to Helena she said she
would tell the whole story, and that it would
look as black for me as for her. ‘Only I
shall go home where no one knows or cares,’
she said, ‘except mother, who can’t defend her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>plan, and you will stay here&mdash;or you’ll stop
and teach and never get a decent position, because
they won’t recommend a cheat.’ So
I’ve kept on. When you asked me to come
and live here Helena was furious. She said
she couldn’t come to see me here without being
seen&mdash;of course things have leaked out,
and she’s been suspected of getting help, but
nothing has ever been proved. I wouldn’t
give in&mdash;I wanted so to come.</p>

<p>“But I did arrange to have a room away
from the others, and I’ve kept the door locked
so they wouldn’t come in suddenly and find
her here or see a paper I’d written for her to
hand in. She gets stupider and lazier all the
time, I think. She can’t do the simplest
thing for herself now. She had an absurd
story ready to explain all this. I told her I
wouldn’t help her with it. I’m sick of being
the brains of Helena Mason. I want to be
myself&mdash;to have the use of my own ideas and
abilities. I’m tired of selling my brains and
my self-respect for a college education that
other girls earn easily with their hands. It
wasn’t a fair bargain. Of course I shall pay
back the money as soon as I can. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>whether I go or stay, I shall be free from
now on to be myself&mdash;not a nonentity sucked
dry to help a rich girl get into Dramatic Club
and Philosophical and the Cercle Français,
and to make a reputation for the brains her
mother admires. Now you understand me,
Miss Wales. Tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>Betty hesitated. “I’m not sure that I do
understand. You mean that you’ve actually
written all Helena Mason’s papers?”</p>

<p>Esther nodded. “Ready for her to copy.
At first I only corrected hers, but for nearly
two years I’ve written them outright. And
I’ve studied nearly every lesson for her&mdash;taken
all the notes for us both, and recited as
little as possible myself, so the resemblances
in our work shouldn’t be noticed. Now I
shall come forward and take part in things.
Oh, it will be splendid, Miss Wales!” She
paused uncertainly. “But perhaps you think
I’ve been too dishonest to deserve a loan from
the Student’s Aid, or any chance of earning
money. If I’d only known, before I came,
that there were plenty of chances! I didn’t
realize it even after I came, when Helena first
proposed my doing the things that seemed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>me unfair. I did them because I hated to
quarrel with her&mdash;and after I’d done them
she held them over me. She’s not as mean
as she seems, Miss Wales. Her mother has
brought her up to feel that appearances are
the only thing that count.”</p>

<p>The cloak of diffidence and reserve had
fallen away from the girl. She could speak
for herself and for her friend in eloquent defense.
Betty watched and listened, amazed
at the sudden change in her. She was free at
last to be herself.</p>

<p>“No,” Betty said at last, “I don’t think
you have forfeited your chance. Mrs. Mason
was most to blame, in suggesting the plan and
not then seeing that her daughter did her
own work. Helena shall have another chance
too, if I can arrange it for her and she will
take it; but it will probably mean explaining
to her teachers how her work has been done
so far. With you”&mdash;Betty considered&mdash;“I
don’t see why you shouldn’t let them explain
the change in you to suit themselves. You’ll
be a great mystery to them”&mdash;Betty smiled at
her. “We’ve called you that&mdash;the Mystery&mdash;Mrs. Post
and I, when we’ve talked about you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>I’m glad our Mystery is solved at last. You
haven’t seemed quite real to me up in your
lonely tower room.”</p>

<p>“Haunted by ghosts,” added Esther, with
a sad smile. “I know what the girls have
thought, you see. I couldn’t say anything.
Now I suppose there’ll be more stories, especially
if Helena leaves college.”</p>

<p>But the Thorn had arranged that. “I’ve
told the girls that loyalty to you means
silence, Miss Wales,” she explained to Betty.
“I proved to them how dangerous it is to
guess about queer things like that, and
they’ve all promised not to say a word about
anything they saw. Of course”&mdash;the Thorn
couldn’t resist so fine a chance to plume herself
on her superiority&mdash;“finding that paper
and the fire-escape business and Miss Mason’s
story about it can’t help giving me some very
interesting suspicions, but they shall never
pass my lips.”</p>

<p>Next Betty went to see Helena, prepared to
offer to help her through her crisis; but
Helena had made her plans and was determined
to abide by them.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stay on, Miss Wales,” she said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>“and I certainly don’t want to. I’ve had a
good time here, laughing in my sleeve at the
people I’ve taken in with my clever stories,
and pretty verses&mdash;why, the one to Agatha
Dwight actually made a splash that rippled
away down to New York. The funny thing
about it is that the stories and all are like me.
Mother attracts fascinating, out-of-the-way
people, and we’ve always lived among them
in an atmosphere of unusual, fascinating happenings.
How in the world that little
country girl gets hold of it is a mystery to
me. She’s never seen such people, or been
to their dinners or behind the scenes at their
plays. I’ve never even told her much.”</p>

<p>“That’s the mystery of genius,” said Betty,
who had thought a great deal about Esther
Bond. “You never can explain it.”</p>

<p>“And if you haven’t got it,” said Helena
hopelessly, “you can’t get it. I’m not unusual.
I shall never shine except in mother’s
reflected glory. I’m sorry for mother;
she’s wasted so much time and money
trying to make me seem clever. Now she’s
got to get used to having a perfectly commonplace
daughter. I shall do my best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>to make her like the real me, but at any rate
she’ll have to endure me as I am. I shan’t
permit any more efforts at veneering me.
They’re too demoralizing.”</p>

<p>So Helena departed at Easter, amid the
laments of her class. She would have been
editor-in-chief of the “Argus” and Ivy Orator
if she had stayed, they told her.</p>

<p>“I’ve willed my honors to the undiscovered
geniuses,” she retorted daringly. “I’m tired
of being called the cleverest girl in the class.
I’m going home to give the rest of you a
chance. College never exactly suited my
style.”</p>

<p>Heartless, mocking, careless of what she
had stolen, even unconscious of what she was
restoring to the girl in the tower room,
Helena left Harding, and no more ghosts disturbed
the peace of Morton Hall.</p>

<p>One day just before the winter term closed,
Eugenia stopped in to see Betty on her way
home from Miss Dick’s.</p>

<p>“Something’s the matter with Dorothy,”
she said. “I came back early, so you would
have time to run over and see her before she
goes to bed. She seems to be dreadfully disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
about something and homesick and
unhappy. She kept saying that nothing was
the matter, but the tears would come creeping
out. I don’t think she’s sick&mdash;just unhappy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Miss Dick to let her come and
stay with me to-night,” Betty suggested, slipping
on an ulster.</p>

<p>Dorothy flew into her big sister’s arms, and
fairly danced for joy when she was told that
Betty had come to take her home.</p>

<p>“Have things been going criss-cross with
you lately?” Betty asked her, as they ran
back, hand in hand, to Morton Hall.</p>

<p>“Yes,” whispered Dorothy solemnly, “they
have. Do you happen to feel like a reckless
ritherum to-night, Betty dear?”</p>

<p>“Not especially to-night,” laughed Betty.
“Do you?”</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister sighed profoundly.
“Yes. I guess I shan’t ever stop feeling so as
long as I live.”</p>

<p>“Not even if we should make hot chocolate
in a chafing-dish?”</p>

<p>“That would be splendid,” Dorothy admitted
eagerly, “but, Betty dear, it wouldn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>make you feel the same about a person who’d
pretended to be very fond of you and all the
same she did a mean hateful thing, would it
now?”</p>

<p>Betty admitted that hot chocolate might
not be able to wipe out all the sting of false
friendship. “But maybe the person didn’t
mean to be mean,” she suggested hopefully.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s little face was very sober. “I’m
sure she didn’t know how sad it would seem
to me,” she explained. “Betty, let’s play I
was mistaken, and enjoy our hot chocolate as
much as ever we can.”</p>

<p>But when it came time to put out the light,
Dorothy pleaded that it should be left burning
“just a teeny, weeny speck, like a night-lamp.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Dottie?” objected
Betty. “Have you been seeing ghosts
again?”</p>

<p>“Whatever made you think of that?”
asked Dorothy anxiously. “I never said a
single word about ghosts. Besides, I couldn’t
see her again, because I didn’t see her before&mdash;I
only heard her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t see or hear any ghosts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>here,” Betty assured her, turning out the
light. “When I’m around they all vanish,
and real people come in their places. So you
can go to sleep this minute, and sleep as
sound as ever you can.”</p>

<p>An hour or two later Betty, who had given
her bed to Dorothy, and was curled up on the
box-couch, was awakened by the shrill sound
of a little voice pleading piteously. It was
Dorothy, fast asleep but sitting bolt upright
in bed and talking in a strained, perfectly intelligible
monotone.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t, Frisky, please don’t!”
she moaned. “I want to scream so, and I
know I mustn’t. You look terrible in that
white dress. Take down your hands, please,
Frisky, please! I know it’s you, so why do
you go on pretending? I never meant to tell
Betty about your having the candle-shade.
You said you’d forgive me. But you said you
forgave Shirley, and then you frightened her
so that she’ll never get over it. Oh, I mustn’t
scream or they’ll find you out! Please, please
go away, Frisky, and don’t try to frighten me
any more.”</p>

<p>The tears were streaming down the Smallest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
Sister’s face, and she seemed to be in mortal
terror. Betty went to her and shook her
softly awake, soothing her with pet names
and caresses. And then, between sobs, the
whole story came out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty, you must never, never tell, but
Frisky was the ghost! I made her mad at
me because I said she oughtn’t to have taken
a candle-shade from the Tally-ho the night
you asked us two to dinner. I saw it in her
drawer the other day, and I said she ought to
give it right back. And then she told me I
was a meddlesome little thing. But when I
most cried she said she’d make up and forgive
me. But last night when my two roommates
were away, there was a knocking near
the chimney and a moan, and a ghost came
right out of the wall, just as Shirley said,
with its hands up to its face, and it was
Frisky in a white sheet.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you needn’t have been scared
any more,” said Betty soothingly.</p>

<p>“A person in a white sheet is rather scaring,”
declared Dorothy, “especially if you’re
awfully scared to begin with. She glided
around and around, and she wouldn’t speak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>to me when I whispered to her that I knew
her. So then I shivered and shook till morning.
She might have scared me just as she
did Shirley&mdash;she couldn’t tell. Shirley will
stutter and her eyes will twitch always, the
doctor says. But Frisky called me her funny
little chum to-day, and just laughed when I
accused her of being the ghost. And I can’t
quarrel without telling why, and if I tell,
something perfectly dreadful will happen to
Frisky.”</p>

<p>“She well deserves it for frightening and
tyrannizing over you little girls,” said Betty
severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty, you mustn’t tell! You promised
not to. Only always let me come and
stay with you when my roommates are
away.”</p>

<p>“You certainly shall,” Betty promised,
“and do hurry and get ready for college,
Dottie. Boarding-school girls are such complete
sillies!”</p>

<span class="smaller">FRISKY FENTON’S FOLLY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thayer’s</span> May party was to be a Doll
Festival. Georgia had thought of it, and she
and Fluffy Dutton had made sure that the
college was “properly excited” over its “features.”</p>

<p>“No use taking the darling dolls home,”
Georgia declared. “The new climate wouldn’t
agree with them. No use packing them away
in messy boxes, with books and pillows and
pictures. By next fall the doll fever will be
over.</p>

<p>“There can be doll dances in costume, and a
doll play, if Madeline isn’t too famous to
write one. The May-pole dancers can be
dressed like dolls too.”</p>

<p>Fluffy sighed and interrupted: “Shan’t
you mind at all parting with Wooden?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” returned Georgia, the matter-of-fact.
“Let’s get a paper ready for the
girls to sign, with the number of dolls they
can furnish opposite their names.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>Straight signed for one doll without a murmur
of protest, but it was not Rosa Marie
that she put on the pile in Georgia’s borrowed
express cart on the day of the May party.
Not even to her beloved Fluffy did she confide
her intention of never, never parting from
her dear Rosa Marie.</p>

<p>The party was on the factory lawn, and the
college part of it overflowed hungrily into the
Tally-ho’s territory, or climbed up to view the
animated scene comfortably from the Peter
Pan’s upper stories. The doll dances and
May dances came first, and then everybody
gathered around the pile of dolls that rose
like a haystack on the slope of the hill, while
Babbie led the little girls one by one, beginning
with the smallest and most forlorn and
ragged, up to the pile to choose a doll.
Georgia strutted like a peacock because
Wooden was the very first one selected, and
Fluffy refused to be comforted when the fat
little Polander who had chosen her Esquimaux
promptly sat down on it and cracked
its skull.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dearie,” Straight consoled
her. “Having dolls to smash is part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>fun of having them at all. Mr. Thayer will
glue it together, and that child will never
think about the crack.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” gulped Fluffy, “how fond you
get of everything you have up here at college&mdash;your
friends and your room, and even your
footless little toys.”</p>

<p>“Because they’re the very last toys we’ll
ever, ever have,” said Straight soberly.
“Why didn’t you keep the Esquimaux, if you
cared so much?”</p>

<p>“Because I kept the Baby and its nurse,”
explained Fluffy shamefacedly. Whereupon
Straight confessed to having bought a substitute
for Rosa Marie, and the twins departed
to the Tally-ho to celebrate their perfect harmony
of spirit in cooling glasses of lemonade.</p>

<p>Betty was catering for the party, acting as
special reception committee for all the shy
and friendless factory hands, and finding time
between to consult flitting members of the
“Proper Excitement” and “Proper Encouragement”
committees. Money-making summers
must be arranged for some of the Morton
Hall girls, and positions assured for many
needy seniors. Betty had started a Harding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>teacher’s agency, and already the demands
upon it were almost greater than the supply.</p>

<p>“But I don’t intend they shall teach unless
they really want to,” Betty decreed, “and
not unless they’re at least a little fitted to.
Teaching isn’t the only way for earning
money&mdash;look at the Tally-ho. Mr. Morton
wants a private secretary if I can honestly
recommend one. He’s been telling his friends
about my ideas of fitting people to positions,
and I got the funniest letter from one of them&mdash;a
very distinguished author. She said the
woman question would soon be settled if I
kept on insisting that a woman’s work should
be her true vocation. Best of all, she wants a
manager for a lace shop she is interested in,
and a chaperon for her two daughters who are
to study art in Paris next winter. Those are
two splendid openings.”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of dolls left,” Babbie announced,
having finished her distribution.
“I think Bob would like them sent to New
York for her floating hospitals and playgrounds.
Where shall we put them? I’m
afraid it’s going to rain.”</p>

<p>“In the Tally-ho workroom,” Betty decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
rapidly. “It does look like rain.
Then we’d better have the ice-cream and cakes
in the club-house. Where’s Nora? Babbie,
could you ask Mr. Thayer to tell them all to
go to the club-house? Why will it always
pour on garden parties?”</p>

<p>She had just found Nora, sent her to give
new orders to the men who were carrying the
ice-cream, made sure that Bridget had taken
all the cakes over, and started across the lawn
herself, when the storm broke&mdash;a pelting
spring shower that sent her scurrying back to
the deserted Tally-ho in search of an umbrella
and rubbers. Before she had found them, a
forlorn, dripping little figure fell upon her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty dear,” cried the Smallest Sister,
“I went to the party to find you&mdash;Mr. Thayer
asked me to come, but I only went to find
you. And I didn’t like to climb the fence, as
long as it was a party, so I came all the way
around, and I’m soaked. Betty, something
awful has happened. Frisky has run away.”</p>

<p>Betty stared in dismay. “Dorothy, I
haven’t a minute to spare now. Take
Emily’s umbrella and hurry home and get
off those wet things. I’ll come to see you to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
but I can’t possibly stop now&mdash;nothing
will go right if I’m not there.”</p>

<p>“About the ice-cream, you mean?” demanded
Dorothy. “To-night will be too late
to do anything about Frisky.”</p>

<p>“But, dearie,” Betty told her, “I can’t do
anything about Frisky. If she’s run away
from Miss Dick’s school, why, Miss Dick is
the one to attend to it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dick doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then why not tell her instead of me?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Dorothy simply, “you
always know what to do. Miss Dick and
Kittie Carson wouldn’t know. They’d never
find her and never get her to come back.
Isn’t it very awful indeed to run away and be
an actress, Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty laid down her umbrella, wrapped her
coat around Dorothy, and with one anxious
glance in the direction of the supper that she
was relentlessly abandoning bent her energies
to settling her responsibilities toward Frisky
Fenton.</p>

<p>“Does any one else know where Frisky has
gone?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I think maybe her roommates do. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>came and told me this morning, and gave me
a blue ribbon for a keepsake. She said she
couldn’t bear to go without any good-byes to
her chums. She said, ‘Don’t tell any one,’
but of course she didn’t mean you. She
knows I tell you everything since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And where has she gone?”</p>

<p>“To the Junction, to join that company
that was acting here all last week. They’re
going ’way out west after to-night. That’s
why you must hurry.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth did she do that, Dottie?”</p>

<p>“’Cause her stepmother was so unsympathetic,”
explained Dorothy, “at Easter vacation,
you know, about a new hat, and a party,
and going to see Miss Dwight in Miss Madeline’s
play. And yesterday Miss Dick scolded
her and kept her in to write French verbs.
So she just decided to go off and be an actress.”</p>

<p>“And why do you think I can get her to
come back?”</p>

<p>“’Cause she said once she’d love to have a
sympathetic sister like you. You understand
exactly how girls feel.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Dorothy went on, “you know an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>actress. Frisky knows three&mdash;Miss Dwight
and the ones that are the hero and heroine in
this company. She went to a play they acted
here one afternoon called ‘East Lynne,’ and
she waited outside by the back door and met
them, and they encouraged her.”</p>

<p>“But, Dorothy, I thought you weren’t intimate
with Frisky any more since you found
out she was the ghost.”</p>

<p>“We never stopped being chums,” said
Dorothy, bursting into a sudden flood of
tears. “I’m sure she’ll be sick of being
by herself by to-night, and scared, and I almost
think she’d expect me to send you after
her.”</p>

<p>Betty looked at her watch. It was nearly
six. The next train to the Junction would be
the theatre express. “All right, little sister,
I’ll go,” she said cheerfully. “Only I can’t
take the whole responsibility. You must let
me send a note to Miss Dick.”</p>

<p>So Betty wrote Miss Dick that Francisca
Fenton had gone to the Junction alone on a
foolish errand, that she was going after her on
the theatre train, and that if Miss Dick wished
to come too they could go together. “But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>I’m quite sure I can manage alone,” she added,
“and perhaps she would feel less humiliated
at having me find her.”</p>

<p>And as Miss Dick didn’t appear at the
train, it was to be presumed that she shared
the general faith in Betty Wales.</p>

<p>As she sped to the station Betty noted the
name of the company&mdash;“Pratt Players”&mdash;on
a dilapidated bill-board, and on the train she
planned out her campaign. She would drive
to the place where they were playing, and if
Frisky was there or they knew where she
was, all would be plain sailing. If not, the
police and private detectives must be put
to work, under pledges of secrecy. She
couldn’t see that Miss Dick would be needed,
no matter which way things went.</p>

<p>But she had no sooner arrived at the Junction
than her plans were suddenly thrown all
awry. None of the station officials, none of
the cabmen at the corner, knew anything
about the Pratt Players.</p>

<p class="p2b">“‘The Pink Moon’ at the Lyric, Shakespeare
at the Grand, and I’m not sure about
the Paxton,” the man at the information
bureau told her glibly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="350" alt="“WE’LL FIND ’EM, MISS,” HE ASSURED HER"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“WE’LL FIND ’EM, MISS,” HE ASSURED HER</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p class="p2">A cabman remembered that the Paxton
was closed. “But ‘The Pink Moon’ is a
great show, ma’am,” he assured Betty.
“Drive you there for fifty cents.”</p>

<p>Betty sped back to the information bureau.
“Pratt Players?” repeated the man inside.
“Pratt Players? Some ten-twenty-thirty outfit,
I s’pose, doing a week at some little
nickel theatre or music hall. City’s full of
them, miss.&mdash;Next train to Boston leaves in
twenty minutes.&mdash;Lunch-room down-stairs,
ma’am.&mdash;Where in South Dakota did you say
you want to go?”</p>

<p>Betty turned away sick at heart. She had
a vision of herself being driven aimlessly from
one nickel theatre to another, in a vain search
for the Pratt Players, while Frisky&mdash;&mdash;If
only Miss Dick were here! She might telegraph
for her. But first she pocketed pride
and discretion and consulted the friendly cabman
again. He had never heard of the Pratt
Players. “But we’ll find ’em, miss,” he assured
her, “if it takes all night. Got a friend
in the company, miss?”</p>

<p>Betty turned away with much dignity
toward the telegraph office. On the way she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>tried to think what 19&mdash; girls had lived at the
Junction. If only she could remember one
she knew well enough to take with her on
her quixotic search! There was a sudden
press of people coming in from a newly arrived
train. Betty stood aside forlornly to
let them pass, when she felt her hand caught
in a strong clasp and looked up to find Jim
Watson towering over her.</p>

<p>“By all the luck!” he cried. “You here
and alone! Come on to the theatre with me,
Betty. Faculty don’t have to be chaperoned,
even if accompanied by a dimple, do they?
I was hoping to get up to Harding in
time to call on you&mdash;got to be in Albany to-morrow
on business for the firm. I say,
Betty, how long is it since I’ve seen you?”</p>

<p>Betty didn’t wait to answer. “Come,” she
ordered desperately, “and find a cab and help
me hunt for the Pratt Players. I’ll explain
after we’re started. I don’t know when I’ve
been so glad to see somebody I know, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Look sharp now,” Jim told the cabman.
“Extra fare if you hit the right place early
in the game, understand.” Owing to which
inducement cabby wasted but two guesses and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>halted with a flourish in front of the dingy
theatre occupied by the Pratt Players before
the first curtain had risen on the faded splendors
of “East Lynne.”</p>

<p>Jim ordered the cab to wait, tipped a ticket-seller
and a messenger boy to ascertain the
name and whereabouts of the heroine, who
presumably had Frisky in charge, escorted
Betty down a dark alley to the stage-door,
cautioned her to call if anything went wrong,
and leaned comfortably against a post to
await her return from the inner regions.</p>

<p>They had agreed that it would be better for
Betty to go in alone; but she wished, as she
opened the door and groped her way up a
steep, narrow flight of stairs, that she had still
the protection of Jim’s unruffled, confident
presence. She met two men on the stairs.
One took no notice of her, the other tossed a
“Late again, eh? You’ll be docked,” over
his shoulder, and hurried on. At the top of
the flight Betty halted aimlessly. Stage
hands were busy moving battered scenery.
A woman’s querulous voice clamored impatiently
for “Daisy!” Then above everything
rose a man’s angry remonstrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“Promised you nothing! You said you
could dance, and you can’t. If you could,
you’re good for a front row job, with that
face. Oh, well,” in answer to a low-voiced
reminder, “I never thought you meant it.
That was my little jolly. Don’t you know
jolly when you see it, little girl? Where’ll
you stay to-night? Lost all your money?
Well, I’m losing more’n I ever had over this
old show. It ain’t my fault that you got lost
this afternoon along with your pocketbook,
and didn’t get here till it was show-time.
Anyway I haven’t a thing for you at any
hour of the day. If I was you I’d go right
home to my mamma. Here’s two plunks&mdash;that’s
all I can spare. So long, little girl.”</p>

<p>Betty stepped forward toward the voice just
in time to be run down by a frightened, tear-stained
Frisky, clutching two silver dollars
tight in her hand.</p>

<p>“Miss Wales!” she gasped. “Where did
you come from?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a carriage outside to take you
home in,” Betty told her quietly. “So you
won’t need that money. Let’s give it back
and then go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>At that the manager appeared, looking a
little frightened, and protesting stoutly that
he “hadn’t never promised the kid a part.”
And when Betty didn’t offer to dispute him,
he seemed much relieved and grew obsequious
and effusive, so that Betty was glad to remember
that Jim was outside. When they
finally got out to him, past the bowing, mincing
manager, Jim tactfully fell into the rear
of the procession, and rode back on the box
with the driver, so that Frisky, who was hysterical
with humiliation and relief, might
have Betty all to herself.</p>

<p>Her story was just as Dorothy had told it.
After getting to the Junction she had experienced
the same difficulty that Betty had in
finding the elusive Pratt Players; but not
having thought of a cab, and being without
Jim’s effective methods of memory-jogging,
she had walked all the afternoon, losing her
pocketbook in the course of her wanderings,
only to be told by one of her “encouraging”
actor friends that he had only suggested her
joining the company as a bit of harmless,
pleasant “jolly.”</p>

<p>“I’d saved three months’ allowance, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>sold my turquoise ring to Josephine Briggs
for three dollars,” sighed Frisky. “What
will Miss Dick say, Miss Wales, and what
will she write home to my father?”</p>

<p>At the station Jim appeared with tickets
and the cheering information that the next
train wouldn’t go for half an hour. So
Frisky, who had had a banana for lunch and
no dinner, was persuaded to gulp down a
sandwich and a glass of milk, while Betty
thanked Jim so fervently that he took heart
and boldly inquired when he might come to
Harding to make the call he had missed in
the pursuit of Frisky.</p>

<p>On the train Frisky considered her future
and dissolved in floods of woe.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stay without my money,” she
wailed, “but I simply cannot go back and
face the awful scoldings I shall get. Miss
Dick won’t let me out of the school yard for
the rest of the term, and I shouldn’t wonder
if she’d tell the whole story right out in
chapel. If I hadn’t been made to stay by
myself so much and think, I shouldn’t have
thought of so many wrong things to do. I
discovered the secret passage one day when I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>was sent to my room to meditate. Who could
resist trying to be a ghost, Miss Wales, with
that secret passage all fixed up as if on purpose?
I’ve felt awfully about Shirley&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And yet you did it again,” said Betty
sternly, “to Dorothy, who might have been
just as badly frightened.”</p>

<p>Frisky wept afresh. “I know it. She
made me cross, and I didn’t care. Sometimes
I don’t care what happens, Miss Wales, and
other days I love everybody, even Miss Dick
and my stepmother. The worst thing is that
nobody trusts me. I meant to show them
that I could be trusted to get along all right
alone. And then I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;lost my purse,”
sobbed Frisky wildly.</p>

<p>Betty patted her shoulder comfortingly.
“That plan was all wrong,” she said. “Suppose
you were to come and consult me about
things the way Dorothy does? I believe we
could get to be good friends. I know a good
many stage people,” she added craftily, “the
real kind, not the make-believes like those
dreadful ones in the Pratt Company.”</p>

<p>“But if ever I wanted to go on the stage
you’d say no, Miss Wales,” demurred Frisky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>“I should say that Miss Dwight knows
more about it than either of us,” amended
Betty. “We are almost at Harding, Frisky.
Shall I tell Miss Dick to-morrow that I’m to
be your special consultation committee from
now on, and that I’m willing to be responsible
for your good behavior?”</p>

<p>“Responsible for my good behavior?”
Frisky giggled, with a touch of her old irresponsible
gaiety. “But I’m always in hot
water, Miss Wales. I try sometimes, and sometimes
I don’t, but it always ends the same way.”</p>

<p>“So you’re not to be trusted, then,” began
Betty. “I thought you said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Frisky considered it. “If I said
I’d try all the time, and Miss Dick promised
to overlook some little mistakes, and I should
talk things over with you instead of with the
other girls&mdash;I think sometimes they stir me
up on purpose to see the rumpus there will
be. Well, then you’d beg me off with Miss
Dick. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“I’d explain to Miss Dick. I’d ask her
to treat you as she does the oldest and most
responsible girls&mdash;to trust you.”</p>

<p>“She treats them all a good deal like infants,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
murmured Frisky. She turned to
Betty. “Thank you, Miss Wales. I don’t
know why you should do so much for me.
If you are looking out for my good behavior,
I’ll certainly try not to make you sorry or to
get you in a fix with Miss Dick.” Frisky
laughed again.</p>

<p>Betty took the sleepy Francisca home with
her, and risked routing somebody up at Miss
Dick’s to make her report. Miss Dick herself
answered her. “I found your note on my return,”
she explained. “One of Miss Fenton’s
roommates had grown worried and spoken
to me earlier in the day. Miss Carson and I
went down in the afternoon. No, we were
not provided with the company’s name, and
we could not place them. Miss Carson is
staying all night&mdash;the detective reports to
her hourly. I shall wire her at once, of
course. Miss Wales, you have done me an
inestimable service in helping me to fulfil
my trust to the child’s parents. In the
morning you will come over? Certainly,
Miss Wales. Anything, anything! I am
very deeply in your debt.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled, a little later, over the picture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>of the dignified Miss Dick, the subdued
Kitty Carson, and a perturbed detective pursuing
a phantom theatrical troupe and a
pretty girl through the devious ways of the
Junction.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t find them,” she reflected
modestly. “It was Jim. I’m never the one
that does things. It’s just my good luck and
my good friends.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">ARCHITECT’S FINAL PLANS&mdash;CONSIDERED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> danced merrily across the
campus to her office. It was commencement
Monday. Betty hadn’t meant to stay
over at first, but the affairs of the teachers’
agency were not quite settled, and they had
kept her. Besides, Lucile Merrifield graduated,
Georgia was a junior usher, Helen was to
take her Master’s degree, and 19&mdash; was coming
back “in bunches,” as Bob elegantly phrased
it, for an “informal between-years” reunion.
And finally Jim Watson was coming to make
his much-heralded call on this very Monday
evening. Betty had taken him to 19&mdash;’s own
Glee Club concert, and he had suggested celebrating
the anniversary, much to the disgust
of the B. C. A.’s and the rest of the old 19&mdash;
crowd, who found no occasion quite complete
unless they could have Betty Wales in their
midst.</p>

<p>Half-way to her office she was hailed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>President Wallace. “You’ll be back next
year, of course?” he asked. “The Morton
couldn’t do without you.”</p>

<p>Betty blushed and laughed. “I hoped I
could escape without being asked that, because
I don’t know. Mother and father say
they are all right, but I must look them over
and be quite sure before I decide to leave
them again.”</p>

<p>“Very well, only be quite sure also that we
need you here,” the President told her, and
Betty hurried on, thinking hard about the
next year at Morton Hall. It would certainly
be very nice, with the Mystery explained and
happy, Miss Romance departed to make a
home for her devoted suitor, the Digs beginning
to appreciate the inherent reasonableness
of obeying rules, the Thorn no longer
prickly, and the Goop boarding with a married
sister who had providentially come to live in
Harding.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe her manners are worth
the ruin of your disposition and mine,” Betty
had told Mrs. Post, when, in June, the Goop
had horrified the house by appearing at breakfast
collarless and with unbuttoned shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>Besides these improvements six seniors
were leaving&mdash;rather dull, colorless girls,
whose departure would make room for livelier,
more promising material. Betty resolved
that Morton Hall should be the gayest, jolliest
house on the campus&mdash;if she came back.</p>

<p>Frisky Fenton was at the door of her office
to meet her. She had been sitting on the
stairs waiting.</p>

<p>“I’m going home this afternoon, Miss
Wales,” she said. “I’ve taken all my prelims
for Harding, and I hope I’ve passed
most of them. Since I’ve been over here so
much with you, I simply can’t wait to get
into college. Miss Wales, I’ve come to consult
you for one last time. How shall I make
my stepmother love me?”</p>

<p>Betty smiled into Frisky’s melting brown
eyes that were fixed upon her so earnestly.
“Didn’t Miss Dwight advise you to puzzle
that out for yourself, if you wanted to learn
how to win over crowds of people later? But
I know how I should begin. Call her
mother. It almost makes you love a person
to call her that. And if you love her and try
to please her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve thought of another thing to do,”
Frisky took her up. “I shall pretend she’s
like you. I’ve noticed that when people expect
a great deal of me&mdash;as you do, Miss
Wales&mdash;I manage to come up to it. Perhaps
if I expect my&mdash;mother to be like you&mdash;to
understand and sympathize&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And scold hard too, sometimes,” laughed
Betty. “Don’t forget that part of me.”</p>

<p>The girl whom Betty had picked out as a
possible secretary to Jasper J. Morton opened
the door, and Frisky held up her flower-like
face to be kissed and went off, a mist in her
eyes at the parting. The prospective secretary
didn’t stay long; if she hadn’t been
a born “rusher,” capable of getting through
intricate discussions and momentous decisions
in double-quick time, Betty would
never have thought of recommending her.
And then, with not time enough before
her next appointment to begin on anything
important, Betty drew out a sheet
of paper and began drawing up rules, à la
Madeline.</p>

<p>“If I come back next year,” she headed the
page:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Rule One</i>&mdash;All ghosts whatsoever are
tabooed.</p>

<p><i>Rule Two</i>&mdash;Boarding-schools need not
apply for assistance.</p>

<p><i>Rule Three</i>&mdash;Matrons shall arrive on time
and never be ill.</p>

<p><i>Rule Four</i>&mdash;In short, bothers, fusses,
complications, mysteries, worries, and
everything else that makes life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
</div>

<p>Betty paused for an adjective, finally decided
upon “interesting,” and threw down
her pen with a little laugh. “That’s exactly
it,” she thought. “Work and bothering and
planning are what make life worth living
and bring the big things around your way.
Some day Morton Hall will run itself, as the
Tally-ho does. Until then&mdash;&mdash; Come in,
Miss Smith. Yes, I have heard from that
school. Can you get a reference for Latin?
There is one first year class that this teacher
may have to take. You failed in Livy? Oh,
I am sorry, Miss Smith! Yes, I understand;
it was when you were a freshman and never
dreamed of having to teach. But the Latin
department could hardly recommend you,
could it? Let me see what other places are
vacant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>It was a long, busy morning&mdash;a thoroughly
grown-up, responsible morning for the Small
Person behind the Big Desk. Once she rushed
to her window to see the Ivy procession wind
its snowy, green-garlanded way past, and again
she deserted her post to hear the Ivy Song
and to watch the pretty picture the seniors
made as they sang. But neither Babbie’s gay
pleading, Mary Brooks’s mockery, nor Helen’s
mournful sympathy could shake her purpose.
She was going to “tend up” to the business
in hand, until it was done. It might be
deliciously cool and as gay and amusing as
possible down under the swaying elms. 19&mdash;
might be holding an “experience meeting
illustrated with tableaux, blue prints, and
babies” under the Hilton House birch tree.</p>

<p>“I can stand it to miss all that,” Betty
confided to Mary Brooks, “but if the afternoon
people don’t come on time and don’t
hurry through, so I can go on our own special
picnic, I shall fairly weep on their shoulders.”</p>

<p>So the last of the “afternoon people”&mdash;a
leisurely freshman who had taken ten minutes
to decide between two rooms in Morton Hall&mdash;was
surprised to see the patient, dignified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>secretary of the Student’s Aid dart past her
down the stairs, sprint, hatless, her curls
flying, across the campus, and shriek wildly
at a passing flat-car, which slowed up for a
minute while a dozen willing hands caught
the panting little secretary and pulled her up
and on.</p>

<p>It was a flat-car picnic, in memory of old
days. There were ginger-cookies for Roberta,
who ate an unbelievable number of them, and
chocolate éclairs for everybody, because on the
sorrowful senior picnic there had been almost
nothing else. This time there was bacon,
sliced very thin, to toast on pointed sticks,
rolls, some of Bridget’s delicious coffee keeping
hot in thermos bottles, a huge chocolate cake,
and dozens of little raisin pies&mdash;the Tally-ho’s
very latest specialty.</p>

<p>“Where is Madeline?” asked Betty, helping
to start the fire. She had spent the trip out
in catching her breath, cooling off, and borrowing
hairpins to replace those lost in her
flight.</p>

<p>“In the gym basement,” explained Christy,
“with Nita and Jean Eastman. They’re the
costume committee for the aftermath parade,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>you know. They boasted that they had done
themselves proud before they came up here,
but this morning Madeline had a great
thought and they’ve been hard at it all day.
They may come out later for supper.”</p>

<p>“We promised to hang out a sign,” Rachel
remembered, and borrowed Helen’s red
sweater, which, tied by the sleeves to a
sapling down near the fence, pointed unerringly
to the presence of picnickers on the
hill.</p>

<p>“If you don’t send Mr. James Watson
packing the minute the concert is out, you’ll
miss the sensation of this commencement,”
Madeline warned Betty solemnly when she
arrived. There was a smudge of brown paint
across her white linen skirt, and Nita declared
feelingly that she would never make another
pair of wings, no, not for any aftermath
parade that ever was. These were the only
clues to the extra-special features that they
had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>At seven the returning flat-car halted by
the fence, and the revelers went singing
home to dress for the concert.</p>

<p>“Come to the gym basement for your costume,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
Nita whispered to Betty and K.
“Find me or Jean. Madeline is as likely as
not to forget all about being there.”</p>

<p>When Jim and Betty reached the campus it
was gay with lanterns, and girls in evening
dress and their escorts were everywhere.</p>

<p>“How about a hammock in a quiet spot?”
suggested Jim. “The music is prettiest from
a distance, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>Of course, all the hammocks were full long
since, but the obliging Georgia Ames and three
other footsore junior ushers politely vacated
theirs, insisting that they were only resting
for a minute, and Jim sat on the ground at
Betty’s feet and inquired for her stage-struck
friend, the cheery Mrs. Post, and the Morton
Hall-ites, and then for Betty’s summer
schedule.</p>

<p>“I might be in Cleveland,” Jim announced
tentatively. “The firm is working on plans
for two houses out there.”</p>

<p>“Then you could come out to the cottage
for Sundays,” Betty said cheerily. “Will
would love to take you sailing. I hate to go
in those bobbing little boats, so I stay on
shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not so very keen about sailing, either,”
Jim said.</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid you’d better not come,”
Betty told him sweetly. “Sailing and swimming
are positively the only amusements out
there.”</p>

<p>“Except talking to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m the family cook,” Betty explained.
“If you think I’m busy here, you should see
me bustle around in summer.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Jim changed the subject. “Is
Morton Hall to the queen’s taste since we
fixed the linen rooms?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Jim,” Betty assured him. “It’s
a model&mdash;any amount nicer than the other
campus houses.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the firm,” Jim said, and then
was quiet so long that Betty inquired laughingly
if he had been to the Bay of the Ploshkin
after his blues.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he told her. “I’ve felt like it
sometimes, but I was afraid I’d worn out
your sympathy. I say, Betty, you’ll write to
a fellow once in a while, won’t you? And if
I should come to Cleveland&mdash;doesn’t the
family cook get her evenings off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>“Some of them.”</p>

<p>“Betty, Betty, Betty Wales!” chanted an
unseen chorus. “Time to dress for the aftermath
parade!”</p>

<p>So Jim said a hasty good-bye and waited
under the group of elms that Betty had
pointed out, to see 19&mdash; march by. Somebody
had suggested having a costumed procession
this year, and the seniors and half a
dozen recently graduated classes had vied
with one another in planning queer and effective
uniforms. There were masked classes,
classes with red parasols, classes with purple
sunbonnets and purple fans, classes with
yellow caps and gowns. But 19&mdash;’s close-fitting
green robes were lighted up by weird
green torches, and in the middle of the ranks
marched all the 19&mdash; animals&mdash;the Jabberwock,
the Green Dragon, the Mock Turtle
and the Gryphon from an Alice in Wonderland
show, ploshkins in assorted sizes with
pink shoe-strings waving in their paws, and
finally a little reckless ritherum hopping
along in the rear. It jumped at the waving
pink shoe-strings, it snatched a green lantern
from the hands of a green-robed figure and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>charged with it blithely into the laughing
crowd, and when it came to the elm trees
where Jim was standing it darted straight at
him and whispered, “Good-bye again, Jim.
Do manage to come to Cleveland sometimes
and talk to the cook,” and was off again after
a pink shoe-string before Jim had discovered
what was happening to him.</p>

<p>An hour later Betty shed her ritherum
costume&mdash;it was rather warm, being composed
of Georgia’s gym suit, the burlap that Lucille
had bought to pack around her Morris chair,
a peacock feather fan, and a pair of snowshoes
for wings&mdash;and she and Madeline,
Roberta, Rachel, K., Nita, Helen, the B’s, and
Christy went out on the fire-escape to cool off
and watch the other classes coming home.</p>

<p>“Must be jolly to stay up here all the time,”
said Nita hungrily. “There’s always something
going on, and it’s all queer and different
and fun.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty good world, wherever you are,
I think,” announced K. briskly.</p>

<p>“It’s whatever kind you make it,” Madeline
amended K.’s sentiment.</p>

<p>“And we’re all making it something rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>nice that it wouldn’t be, perhaps, without us,”
Roberta added.</p>

<p>“We’ve never decided what it takes to
make a B. C. A.,” said Madeline. “If we had
we could tell Nita, and she could cultivate the
combination.”</p>

<p>“We shall have that left for conversation
at the first tea-drinking next fall,” laughed
Christy. “There are always such dreadful
pauses.”</p>

<p>“It’s always well to have something left
for next fall just the same,” said little Helen
primly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Rachel, who was secretly
considering a year’s study in New York.
“There may be more of us B. C. A.’s and
there may be less, but there’ll surely be a
topic of conversation.”</p>

<p>“And an Object,” added Madeline, hugging
Betty, “with curls and a dimple, and a
finger in everybody’s pie, and a few over.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s just what Jim Watson said
about me,” laughed Betty, “only he didn’t
call it pie.”</p>

<p>“Jim Watson,” said Madeline severely, “is
politely requested to keep his distance. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>can’t spare you to him&mdash;not for years and
years and years to come.”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” echoed Christy,
Rachel, and Helen in an indignant chorus.</p>

<p>“Girls, please stop talking such perfect
nonsense,” said Betty calmly. “Let’s climb
down the fire-escape and go to bed.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
